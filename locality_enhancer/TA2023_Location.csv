Re: Coronavirus (Covid-19) Information in Hong Kong,"Hotel Situation in HK during the CoronaVirus Outbreak At present, hotel room rates around the city remain at deeply discounted levels. I'm finding properties in the 2-4 star range offering prices, even on weekends that are 25-33% their normal rates of the past few years. Some 5 star properties are offering discounts as well but not at the same level of concessions that you will find with the midrange category places. As such, it is not necessary to reserve hotel rooms far in advance this year. You can wait until much closer to your intended dates of travel, to ensure your trip isn't cancelled. Then book with 1 week or so of your intended travel to Hong Kong. This situation may change later in the year but many of us feel that it is not likely as we have a major protest movement that is presently set on pause while the city deals with the Coronavirus Outbreak. After the virus outbreak settles, if the protests return to the same levels of activity that we saw last autumn, visitors will likely continue to remain away from HK in mass numbers. If this happens, hotel room rates will probably stay quite low as well. Edited: 4 years ago"

Re: Coronavirus (Covid-19) Information in Hong Kong,"Post #12 Update - on updated museum reopenings I visited the Heritage Museum yesterday and HKMOA this afternoon. The procedures are simple. They have three 2 hour slots with 30 minute closings in between in order to clean and disinfect. Small number of visitors are allowed to enter, not sure the exact count but there were very few during my visits. There are announcements starting 10 minutes before the end of the session, informing you to begin exiting the museum. You'll find hand gel tubs in quite a few of the galleries as well. All rather straight-forward, very few others in the museums and everyone is quite spread out, making it potentially a safer place to be than out on the streets or in the malls. A last word - The HKMOA renovations are really nice and the Turner to Hockley exhibition of British landscapes from London's Tate is a great way to kick off the reopening of the museum."

Worst by far is the schools being closed for two full months now, and at the very least another month to go and probably even longer, easily another month before it's all reopened. No idea what's going to happen to all those cross border students, and the year end (or even school end!) exams... Also schools are bound to require their students to wear masks, but no-one knows where to get that extra million or so of masks needed daily for that to happen."

Re: Coronavirus (Covid-19) Information in Hong Kong,"There is overall social distancing as evident by the lesser number of people walking around, using public transport and eating out. A lot of restaurants have gone out of business or are operating with more limited hours. Many people I know still work from home. Even my office is letting staff out an hour early to avoid the worst of the traffic (=crowds). There have been no hard rules to close any business though. The only closures were facilities controlled by the government. Many of them are starting to open again though some with just limited service. I have a friend with two children (8 and 10) who has only gone out just once to dine since the virus hit. On most days, she stays home while her husband goes to work and does all the shopping. I also know people who have been working from home since CNY. Some elderly folks I know have scrapped their weekly mahjong meetings. This past weekend though, it was noticeable that more people were out and about. A restaurant that I walk past often was at 70-80% capacity, vs maybe just 30% two weeks ago. We visited the HKMOA several months ago before the virus hit. It's indeed a nice place. The architecture is very interesting. Even though I don't know much about Chinese art, the exhibits are very well done. They have a small section on Western art as well though obviously, European museums and the NY Metropolitan offer more famous works."

Re: Coronavirus (Covid-19) Information in Hong Kong,"Public transport: sure, with the schools closed that's less people. The lack of tourists is also telling in transport. Transport has been getting notably more crowded over the past two weeks, East Rail Line is much less crowded than normal, in a large part thanks to the lack of cross border traffic. Walking around: not any less crowded than normal in Tai Po (an area that normally sees little to no tourists). Last Saturday the malls were as crowded as ever. Restaurants had their usual lines; I have yet to see a restaurant that closed or that's significantly less crowded. I did notice two dispensaries that closed down (permanently), and at least one Chow Tai Fook closed (temporarily - shop is still there, just closed for business). I've also not seen any closed shops in Ap Lei Chau where I currently work; another corner of Hong Kong that rarely sees tourists normally. As I started there early Feb I can't tell whether the current crowds (which to me feel normal for such areas) are less than normal. So it seems the locals don't go out much less than usual; but if you live in a tourist-heavy area no doubt you will see relatively quiet streets and struggling restaurants. I haven't visited Lan Kwai Fong or Soho recently, especially the latter area I've heard starts to resemble a ghost town with most units boarded up."

Re: Coronavirus (Covid-19) Information in Hong Kong,"Recently in the news a complaint that many deaths in the UK were not appropriately credited to the coronavirus, especially for people dying in a care home. Only by looking back we can get an estimate; an unusually high peak of deaths (normally in winter the number of deaths is far higher than in summer) which can be accredited to this virus, plus probably a good number of others, people who would have died that winter anyway but it just happened to be the coronavirus that was the last straw. Then the problem that measurements of the numbers of people that are infected are often way too low - today it was reported that based on recently donated blood some 3% of the Dutch now have been infected with the virus (and of course recovered, as otherwise they wouldn't be allowed to donate), that'd mean half a million infections, while there are just over 28,000 confirmed infections in the country. That suggests just 5% of the infections makes it into the statistics. There is no extensive testing for the disease, only severe cases are formally tested. Then there rae the many people that may die or lose part of their remaining life due to cancelled/delayed medical procedures, including cancer treatment. Plus the years lost due to the stress caused by having your business collapse and ending up riddled in debt, maybe losing your home in the process, etc. The economic cost will be very hard to estimate. Many businesses collapse, quite a few of whom no doubt were the weaker ones, creating openings for new businesses to pop up (a recession is not necessarily a bad thing). People out of jobs, but likely the economy can revive quickly when it's all over and jobs will return, especially the tourism related ones as people are most likely just postponing travel plans rather than cancelling forever. Too bad the HK government doesn't seem to care much about the unemployed. Even the US is doing a lot better on that front at the moment."

So from this, As a non-resident, I can enter HK through Shenzhen by as I have not been to any other overseas countries and regions in the past 14 days. Then would go through the 14 day quarantine at a hotel. Is my understanding correct? I wish immigration could be clearer on this, but no one there wants to take the blame if they give the wrong information when asked. I'm a US citizen in Mainland for the past 5 months and used up my 60day visa, + the one time extension + the 30 day stay permit and the entry/exit bureau here say I need to leave by the end of my permit.

Non-residents who have been in China, Macau or Taiwan for more than 14 days before arriving in HK will be allowed entry, after which they have to go through the 14 days of quarantine. Now in your case I suppose you will want to fly out immediately (or at least within 14 days upon arrival). I don't know the rules in that case. I have heard about mainlanders being allowed to transfer through HK from the airport directly to Shenzhen Bay. You will have to contact the Hong Kong immigration department directly about this, I can very well imagine that they can give you permission to bypass or break quarantine to catch a flight out."

Re: Coronavirus (Covid-19) Information in Hong Kong,"Hong Kong Covid testing on airport arrival (27 June 2020) Any person entering Hong Kong through the Airport must undergo Covid testing. Those who test positive are taken to hospital for treatment, while those who test negative are required to isolate for 14-days. There seems to be some discretion as to whether the incoming traveller must serve the quarantine at their home or a government facility. Our flight touched down shortly before 11am. Upon disembarking the aircraft, we were channelled to a section of the arrivals hall. The health clearance involves multiple steps. First, to show a health declaration - either complete through the government's app and show the QR code or on a paper form available at the arrivals hall. All arriving passengers must download a government app and provide a mobile telephone number to be monitored. Fortunately, we had a Hong Kong mobile number otherwise we might have incurred a large roaming bill. Members of one household can share the mobile number. Next, a quick interview on the quarantine procedure. We would have to undergo a Covid-19 test. Those who test negative could leave for their own place of quarantine for 14 days. Those who test positive would be sent to a hospital. Following the interview, a health official installed a wrist band that must be worn for the entire quarantine period. Then, another interview to receive and accept the notice of quarantine. Following that, we went to the immigration counters, which process is the same as pre-Covid. After passing through the immigration and collecting luggage, we exited through the Customs green lane. Outside, staff directed us to a bus. Then began the waiting. Initially, about 10 minutes for the bus to move and then after 20 or so metres, to wait again along the road. After another 10 minutes, the driver started the bus again and drove the short distance to the EXPO. At the EXPO, we alighted and walked into the Hall, only to be told that the stop was just to deposit checked luggage. We (with only hand held luggage) should have remained on the bus. Anyhow, after another 10 minutes, the other passengers had deposited their luggage and reboarded the bus. The driver took us for another short drive to the other side of the EXPO, where we alighted - finally for the Covid-19 test. We were briefed on the test, given the test materials - a paper funnel and plastic screw-top tube in plastic bags. We skipped the video explanation and walked to the next section to deliver the saliva. It was quite easy for me to fill the small tube (about 10 ml?) but challenging for my wife. Finally, she completed the work and we handed the sealed tubes to the waiting staff, and walked to the next section. And then the long wait began. In the cavernous hall, about 75 metres square, small tables were placed at distances of about 2 metres. Each traveller is assigned to a separate table, but families are allowed to pull chairs to sit together. By the time that we arrived, at around 1pm, the hall was about two-thirds full. The official document stated that we could expect to wait for 8 hours. Passengers whose flights arrived before 12pm could wait in the Hall. Those on later flights would be sent to a hotel to wait overnight. In the hall, passengers on the early morning flights from North America had been waiting since 7am. Some had come well prepared and pitched portable tents in the hall. Around 1pm, staff served sandwiches - either turkey sausage and cheese or vegetarian (tomato, cucumber and cheese). The sandwiches reminded me of national service in the Singapore Army. We could get bottled water from a table on one side of the hall. The staff also helpfully provided some electric power sockets from which travellers could charge their phones. At 3pm, health officials came with forms to release the first batch of travellers. My guess is that the test specimens are despatched in batches to some off-site laboratory and then the forms returned in batches. There was another long wait until 5pm, when a second batch of travellers were released. I guessed that the bureaucracy worked on two hour batches and that we would have to wait until 7pm. Happily, I was wrong. We (the third and last batch in our Hall) were released at 6.30pm. We missed the 6.45pm Airport Express train and had to wait half an hour for the 7.15pm train. And then home to self-quarantine. On arrival, we had to initialize the wristband. The traveller has 60 seconds to walk around their home to enable the wristband detect nearby bluetooth devices. These serve to fix the location of the wristband. (I wonder if we could take a walk with the wristband and all of the nearby Bluetooth devices.) The next day (first day of quarantine), the health authority called to confirm that we were at home. My wife got the Cantonese version which seemed to take twice as long as my version in English. Another 13 days to go."

No other food options available in holding area. - 10 hours later, at 8:00 pm I showed up outside waiting for her. - 3:00 am (17 hours later) test results finally came back - negative as expected, although on her flight there were 9 women who tested positive and will be immediately hospitalized in HK. Suggestions to consider: - consider arriving after 12:00 noon so that you don't have to wait at the airport for 10-18 hours. Instead you will be bussed with other passengers to a Kowloon hotel and provided a private room where can sleep, get modest food, and await test result. - If waiting at the airport, bring large battery bank to keep electronics charged for 12-18 hours. There are charging stations but they are crowded and not much social distancing - Transfer some food into your carry-on bag before leaving customs zone. Once you leave customs, you will be separated from you luggage until you are released from holding area with negative Covid result, then you can collect you bags and go to quarantine hotel (required if from high risk country...list changes so check website). Note, HK customs has almost no food restrictions so fresh fruit, meat, etc can all be brought from other countries. Zero duty on beer and wine. - You can sleep at your table, maybe bring a pillow. Some people brought yoga mats to sleep on the concert floor, but staff said no, it's not clean there. After receiving negative test result she was released to pick up her luggage and went outside where I picked her up with private car and delivered her to a quarantine hotel in TST, Butterfly on Prat (14 nights @US$60/night). Other available transportation options at 3:00 am were taxis. There didn't seem to be any enforcement of transportation options."

Re: Coronavirus (Covid-19) Information in Hong Kong,">> have seen restaurants and bars turn away customers without an proper N95 or better surgical mask. N95, let alone better, you won't be able to find anywhere in the world unless you have special access to medical stocks. Any mask on the market now is not certified, the production process and raw materials are possibly not even tested. Some will advertise with testing certificates, but unless you can verify that this certificate is for the actual product, and is indeed issued by a trustworthy and independent organisation, such a certificate is worth no more than the paper it's printed on. i have never been turned away at a restaurant with my reusable cloth masks (the government issued one actually works quite well with the filter removed: now my breath goes mostly through the cloth instead of almost all around it to the extent that I'm blowing in my own eyes). Restaurant owners are too desperate for business, just to have a fighting chance to keep their business alive. Point in case, just last week I was having my breakfast in a Cafe de Coral outlet where the temperature checking machine was not monitored and generally just didn't work, and where occupancy was way over 50%. I was sitting on a shared table without screen between me and the stranger - I don't know if that is allowed. I do know that in the school where I work it's definitely not allowed due to government regulations! Corona-fatigue is definitely setting in. Hong Kong kept it up for very long already, 9 months or so by now. Not many countries can claim such a willingness of the population to cut down on activities to help slowing the spread of this virus. I haven't been advertising my local guided tours for a year, yet tour or information requests are coming in on a regular basis - nearly daily. More than when I was advertising, and I have the feeling the rate is increasing. Sitting at home all day long does get old after a while!"

I have not seen any normal people walking around wearing one since March when there weren't enough masks of any kind to go around. These days, surgical (or ones that look alike without the function) are easily available. Most restaurants enforce the mask and temperature taking policy pretty well. On the other hand, most also ignore the capacity restriction. The tea cafes next to my office are often 75% to 80% full for breakfast and lunch. Only the large chains and hotels have reduced their seating capacity. I have no problems with the social distancing policies currently in place. They are easy enough to follow. The only inconvenience I experience is office lunch and family gatherings when we have more than 4 people. Yesterday, we had 9 so we sat 4-3-2 across three tables which felt ridiculous. Otherwise, post summer, mask-wearing doesn't feel as suffocating as a few weeks ago. As to ""fatigue"", I haven't cut down on going out so I am not experiencing it much. I have gone to work and gone out on weekends just as I normally would. I am past the party age so the late night restrictions have no bearing on me. On the other hand, I know there are families, especially ones with younger children, that were so afraid to leave the house that they have mostly stayed home for months. I am sure they feel less ""balanced"" as a whole. Finally, based on numbers alone, I see justification in opening the border between HK, China and Macau for selected people. Politics aside, they should at least allow business folks with testing to travel back-and-forth and see how it goes. Edited: 4 years ago"

Re: Coronavirus (Covid-19) Information in Hong Kong,"Passengers on flight arriving in the afternoon and evening will be sent to the government designated holding centre for test result hotel for the first night of their arrival, and are only allowed to proceed to their 14 day quarantine hotel the next day after receipt of a negative result from their Covid-19 test administered at the airport on arrival. This is done as tests administered later in the day cannot produce results the same day. Currently the designated hotel is the Rambler Garden Hotel at Tsing Yi. It is not a very nice hotel at all. Below is my review of my one night stay at the hotel while awaiting my test result in November 2020: As my flight into Hong Kong International Airport arrived in the evening, I was required to stay in the government designated holding center for test result hotel - Rambler Garden Hotel - for the first night of my arrival to await the result of my Covid-19 test administered at the airport on landing. The whole arrival process was very tiring. I exited the plane door at around 7:10 pm and it was about 12:30 am before I arrived at my hotel room at Rambler Garden Hotel with almost the entire process being standing in line waiting for the next step. On arrival at the hotel on the shuttle bus, hotel staff dressed in full protective gear quickly took out our luggage from the shuttle bus before we were then allowed to get off the bus, collect our luggage and proceed to line up to check in. Check in was quick since we only needed to collect our room key, the cost of the stay being paid for by the government. While I was very conscious of keeping some distance between me and the other guests in the check-in line, most people lined up right behind each other, though everyone was required to wear a mask. Just before the elevators to the rooms, the hotel set up a table to hand out a boxed meal dinner, in this case a very mild curry chicken and potato stew with rice and a box of oolong tea. The hotel room is small and very basic. There were two twin beds right next to each other with a little bedside table at the side. There was a TV set up high on the wall at one corner of the room, an empty cabinet except for the hot water kettle and coffee and tea packs, and a very small low table or seat. The bathroom was very tiny and my knees could almost touch the door when seated on the toilet. There was no toilet paper in the holder but there was a new roll of toilet paper on the counter. There was a brand new mini fridge but it was not installed and instead sat on the window sill still wrapped in plastic. The room seemed fine for one evening except that the next morning, in the light of day, I could see that the floor was very dirty and does not appear to have been swept or vacuumed, and that the paint on the wall had piece sticking out and cracks near the bottom where the wall joins the baseboard. There was also paint splatter on the door. Everything seems to have been cheaply put together and not in good condition. The next morning, around 8:30 am, a box set breakfast of glutinous rice wrap and dim sum, with a box of apple juice, was left at my door. We were told we would receive our test results between 11 am and 3 pm, and that if it was negative we must leave the hotel within 25 minutes. Until then, we were strictly forbidden from leaving our room. In fact, there was a sign taped to the door indicating if you leave your room to smoke, you will be reported to the police. Confusingly, while I was in the room the next morning waiting for my result, around 11:15 am housekeeping actually used their master key to open my door causing me to shout out that I am in a mandatory quarantine stay and had not left yet. About 5 minutes later, reception called me around 11:20 am advising I could now leave the hotel. Check out was quick as again we did not have to pay for the stay ourselves. I then took a taxi to travel to the quarantine hotel I arranged for myself for my mandatory self-quarantine. I did note though that staff were very friendly and helpful offering to help with luggage and directing guests to the taxi line or other mode of transportation they selected. Fortunately it was a one night stay only, and as it was mandated and paid for by the Hong Kong government, there is really no choice involved and nothing to be done to avoid this hotel other than to make sure you take a flight arriving in the morning rather than afternoon or evening or to wait until the government's contract with this hotel expires and the government selects another hotel."

The benefit of arriving late is they will put you in the hotel instead of making you wait for your test results (which could take anywhere from 3-12 hours). The drawback is you have to stay at this not-so-great hotel even though it's free.

That said, I suspect they probably have a policy that if you do test positive, then your room would probably get a disinfectant clean. If you test negative, I suppose they think your risk of contaminating the room you occupied with transmissible virus might be low. Hong Kong government just announced today that arriving passengers to Hong Kong will in the future be required to quarantine at designated hotels. Hotels have to opt into this program and if they become a designated hotel for quarantine passengers, then they cannot accept other guests. In addition, they must arrange bus transportation for the quarantine guests to the designated hotel so that guests will not need to take public transportation. When I arrived, after I received my negative test result the next morning, I was allowed to leave Rambler Garden Hotel and travel to my quarantine hotel by whatever means I chose such as taxi, MTR subway, bus etc. It was not clear when the new quarantine hotel rules would come into effect as they would need to allow time for hotels to sign up for the program and clear out their other guests so they can be an exclusively quarantine guests hotel.

That's not enough for 14 days worth of quarantine, especially with an expected increased influx for the Chritmtas holidays, even if most rooms are occupied by two people (I do assume couples or families with children quarantine together). That made me wonder: there are 5-10 imported cases of COVID a day. That means 0.5-1% of all inbound travellers is infected with the virus - extrapolated to the world population that would come to 70-150 million infected people at the moment; a number that's not far off the official number of total infections over the past year! Odd. Really odd."

Re: Coronavirus (Covid-19) Information in Hong Kong,"@senior travelers (post 222) My guess is that sometime in Spring 2022 is more realistic than October 2021 at this juncture in time and here some things you can watch for Hong Kong and Macau officials have just recently restarted talks about opening a quarantine-free travel bubble. This may happen in July 2021 and will be a big test for how and when HK go about reopening to the rest of the world. I would guess that it is most likely that we will be reopen to mainland China in some restricted/limited capacity for quarantine free travel by October. There is also a HK <> Singapore bubble that has been attempted twice but yet to materialise. That will likely be the next if things work out with quarantine free travel to Macau and mainland China. I'd give this a 33-50% chance by October 2021 There is some chance that other regional places that are considered low-risk for quarantine free travel by October 2021. Candidates would be the likes of South Korea, Japan, Cambodia, Australia and New Zealand. I'd say there is 25-33% chance that some form of other regional bubbles start to open this Autumn. By January 2022 I would say this is 50-66% likely. Any way you look at it, you need to see travel restrictions relax for these places first before the HK Authorities begin to consider lifting restrictions more broadly and to countries that are considered higher risk. As for travellers from Europe, North America and the likes, I'd say 1-5% chance by October 2021. In all honestly, I would say 0% but you never know. If further helpful, based on how HK authorities have handed travel restrictions to date, I'd would guess January 2022 (33% chance), April 2022 (50-66% chance), July 2022 (66-75% chance), Sept 2022 (80%+ chance) for open quarantine free travel into HK. These could easily change depending on vaccination drives, how the pandemic is handled by various other countries and other factors but these are the odds I'd give based on what we know today."

Re: Coronavirus (Covid-19) Information in Hong Kong,"Based on recent reports, I think the HK/SIN travel bubble will not happen (or not last), and that quarantine-free travel from Europe/US/most of Asia to HK will also be a very long term thing. First the Singapore bubble: this is based on both sides having less than n local cases a day for x number of days, upon which a limited number of (vaccinated) travellers may go quarantine free. Singapore appears to have completely blown this up: https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/singapore-covid-plan-intl-hnk/index.html?utm_source=pocket-newtab-intl-en Basically, Singapore wants to halt their (so far unattainable) zero-infection policy, instead letting covid be. Stop testing, cancel restrictions, making sure people take their responsibility (are you sick? stay at home) and live with it like we live with so many other diseases such as the common cold and the flu, and allow visitors in without quarantine basically like it used to be. That's not compatible with the travel bubble idea, that will result in way too many virus carriers. HK not opening to the world quarantine free: that's not going to happen until China does so, and China so far has one of the most restrictive entry regimes. The current priority for HK is to reopen travel between the city and China and Macau (both supposedly the same country), and for that the zero-infection policy must stay: https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1598982-20210703.htm China has been making a HUGE point on how the CCP managed to protect their country from covid, how they managed to keep their people safe and healthy from this disease, while most of the rest of the world made a huge mess with everybody getting sick and scored dying. How that propaganda can be made compatible with opening the borders and allowing the disease to go around like what Singapore is suggesting, I don't know. HK apparently chose to give priority to travel between HK and China (and Macau). That means that until China changes its policies on covid, travel between HK and the rest of the world will have to remain severely restricted, with 21-day quarantines regardless of vaccination status, pre-flight testing, and total entry bans for certain groups like travellers from the UK. On top of all that, HK is in an election year (for what it's worth), so the 4-person social gathering ban is politically very convenient."

This also means that arrivals to HK are severely restricted as Penny's Bay can't handle the load, the numbers I find indicate there are only 2,300 units total, minus the 1,000 in use for quarantining domestic helpers leaving a mere 1,300 for general quarantine. This means no more than some 200 arrivals a day from this group A list, or 400 a day if all units house two people. Many travellers are likely forced to rebook their flights as they have to secure quarantine accommodation in Penny's Bay. On the upside, finding space in quarantine hotels should become a lot easier with these restrictions on inbound numbers.

This appears to be an attempt to avoid imposition of the flight suspension mechanism whereby airlines are banned from landing in HK for 14 days when carrying 4 or more passengers during a 7 day period on that route or 3 or more passengers on the same flight who test positive on arrival. Cathay has already had suspensions imposed on flights from Vietnam and New York since the beginning of December."

The main effect on travellers is that in the short term Cathay has cancelled many passenger flights to and from Hong Kong - so if you are booked to fly CX in the next few weeks, do contact them for updates on your flights. So far no immediate changes in the covid prevention rules because of this, even planned mass events will go ahead in the upcoming few days including countdown events later today.

Re: Coronavirus (Covid-19) Information in Hong Kong,Cathay Pacific flights from Manchester and KLM flights from Amsterdam to HK are suspended from 2nd to 15th January under the govt flight suspension mechanism as a result of landing of passengers testing positive in recent days. Cathay's London Heathrow to HK is already suspended until 8th January so that's probably going to come as a blow to passengers hoping to use Manchester as an alternative. Cathay had tried to avoid this situation by bringing forward the requirement for PCR test before boarding its flights from the UK from 48 hours to 24 hours but to no avail.

The moment they open up the border to a foreign place (including China), the disease will creep back into the population. A very good example is New Zealand. They held out for the longest time with an excellent managed isolation quarantine program. Once Omicron hit, they realized the zero Covid goal has become futile changes were made regarding. They have already opened to Australia and they will open to the rest of the world's vaccinated travelers in a few weeks. At present, it's the HK government's fault that they are overloading hospital capacity. It's also entirely unnecessary to shut down so much of the economy trying to achieve an impossible goal.

Re: Coronavirus (Covid-19) Information in Hong Kong,"The main problem for inbound travellers at them moment is the lack of quarantine hotel rooms. Mandatory quarantine is now 14 days, there's talk about reducing that to 7 days, but no confirmation yet. Of course changes in regulations can come at any moment - this ""circuit breaker"" change came just a few hours after Carrie Lam herself said there were no plans of changing this. Quarantine hotel space should start to increase soon again, as a good number of these designated hotels were taken out of the pool to serve as isolation facilities for covid patients that don't need treatment. Those hotels are slowly being transferred back to the quarantine pool. This means more overseas travellers can enter Hong Kong, including a great number of residents now stuck in UK, US and other restricted countries, and of course a replenishment of the foreign domestic helper supply (I know, it's about people, but this particular cohort is commonly talked about as a commodity). Now of interest: Hong Kong has scheduled the 7s for later this year (November, iirc), and the financial secretary has said already that HK will host a major business forum at the same time: https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1640548-20220323.htm The only way such a forum - and the 7s event itself - has any chance of success is a full reopening of the border, and a full cancellation of all covid related restrictions. This is not even part of the current ""roadmap"", which sees social gathering limits to increase to 8 people by this summer. I recall reading about other government bureaus expecting to restart inbound tourism soon, talking about some 9-10 million arrivals within this year. I can't find the reference at the moment. It was unclear whether they were thinking of mainland or overseas visitors. The government has also not given any explanation on how their current restrictions, or the relaxed restrictions promised for this summer, are remotely compatible with the mass events they plan to organise for the 1 July 25th anniversary of the establishment of the HKSAR. However the fact that this has been announced as such is very interesting. On the other hand, Carrie Lam has said that opening the border with the mainland is still top priority... for that to happen we would need to find all infected people and isolate them, and tighten the border restrictions big time.... totally opposite the current trend. https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1640466-20220323.htm So there are clear hints of Hong Kong opening up within this year, but uncertainty remains.

Persons holding a green health declaration QR code will not be required to further verify vaccination records and confirmation of DQH booking at check-in for their flights.

Airport is empty compared to before and the medical testing on arrival was quick and painless. The multitude of information and tests for a stay take sometime to get used to and requires a level of mobile phone sophistication that many elderly people may find challenging. Daily RAT test , with photo proof was easy , only uploading into app didnt work. PCR test at various centres can be a swarm of people or empty depending on luck. The test there was easy and painless, albeit that you need to be somewhat technical with a phone and good eyesight to read a desktop form on a screen. It was here that I was told that many people could not upload their RAT tests - obviously no remedial corrective feedback loop in place. From arrival to 3rd day your code is amber meaning you can travel about but can not go to restaurants , bars or anywhere that requires you to scan your VACINE/TESTING STATUS. Post 2nd day PCR is negative your code changes from amber to blue and theoretically you can go anywhere , including bars and restaurants. HOWEVER, IF YOU HAVE HAD LESS THAN 3 VACCINE SHOTS you may be blue but will be denied entry to restaurants and bars. The plethora of documentation explaining HK's covid and vaccine information doesn't mention this - maybe I missed it.

It's the return trip that might be somewhat complicated depending on where you are heading out from HK as the entry requirement of the country you are entering might be different (COVID test), so check the most current rule.

Not expecting much since I've been asking about exemption due to the pandemic but they just keep giving textbook answers back which, is basically that web page regarding loss of PR... https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/roa/loss.html From what OS_HK1 says, as long as you have 3* and you didn't obtain it by living 7 years in HK (which is category 1 from the page) then you're considered to be of Chinese nationality. For someone born abroad and who has not lived in HK for 7 years, I presume categories 1, 2, 4 would not apply. Just not sure about 5 since being born overseas (i.e. you have an 'O' next to your 3*) would surely mean ""not of Chinese nationality"" and possessing an ID must mean ""permanent residence"" status. That would mean someone born overseas that obtained their ID before 1997 SAR would fall under category 5...? Unless once you have an ID, you're considered a Chinese national, then you don't meet both conditions 🤪 Category 3 might apply too as it refers to anyone with right of abode (letter A) before 1997 SAR but wasn't born in HK...

Otherwise people who didn't leave HK for three years straight (I for one have come a long way towards that) would lose their right of abode status instantly... and that just doesn't make sense. Mind: right of abode is about long term residents. Not occasional visitors. Of course you can maintain that status with short visits after having obtained it by long term residence, a nice perk but not the intended purpose of having a resident status. If you fail to visit Hong Kong for three years straight (if your excuse is the corona crisis it meant you were gone for at least 2 1/2 years already showing not much bond with or interest in the place) then you lose the ROA status, and that I think is a very sensible and fair arrangement."

2,53,13280361,108310976,,,,,,no_one,4 years ago,15,78. Re: Travelling to HK before 3 years run out,"it can be confusing but basically the definition of permanent residency in HK does not include those with RTL - even though as an RTL holder you can live and work in HK without restriction. In practical terms the only difference (afaik) is that PR holders are immune from deportation and can register to vote in local elections. As the last few years have shown as well, non-PR's have been excluded from the various Govt handouts (there was a 6k handout a few years ago plus the ongoing 10k handout currently). As an RTL holder, you are still classed as having residency, just not their definition of permanent, so you should be able to enter HK without any issue at the moment. HOwever, please bear in mind that there are certain limitations on all HK residents returning from certain ""High risk countries"" at the moment (this includes the US and UK) whereby you will need a negative nucleic covid test 72 hours prior to catching your flight, and proof of 14 days hotel accommodation - at a certified quarantine hotel. Without the preflight covid test you will probably be refused by the airline and without the latter...well, I can only assume you will either be carted off to a Govt quarantine camp and charged for the pleasure, or you will simply be refused entry and returned to your country of origin."

Especially for a subsection of the population that, in the current China ethno-nationalist climate, they have no interest in. In reality, at the moment, any return will involve a negative covid test (for a high risk country) and a 14 day stay in a hotel, so it's not even like you can just do a quick in and out for the purpose of resetting your 36 month countdown.

Because you are not of Chinese descent and don't have *** on your card then your ROA will be downgraded to RTL. However, with RTL you can still live and work in HK as a resident. The actual consequences are really in name only (except for some limited rights extended solely to those with full ROA which have been discussed in this thread previously). I doubt Immigration will extend your time, so unless you make it back here within your 36 month limit, you will be downgraded. FWIW you can still travel to HK from the UK as long as you spend 21 days in another country prior to your HK flight.

However, something more important has also been made public recently which impacts many of the people writing on here. If you are born and bred British, American, Canadian, Australian (OR WHEREVER) BUT have a HKID with *** then your foreign nationality is no longer recognised in Hong Kong (it has always been the case for Mainland China). If you enter Hong Kong on your *** ID card, then you will no longer be able to receive foreign consulate help within HK should you need it. The *** means the HK and Chinese Govts consider you to be first and foremost of Chinese Nationality. If you wish to retain your foreign consulate protection whilst travelling in HK and China then you will need to explicitly renounce your Chinese nationality. Unfortunately, this means you will also lose your *** on your HKID. This is why having *** on your ID card means you are no subject to the 36 month limit. There is so much misunderstanding in the overseas Chinese community because they have a habit of relying on poor information via online groups. Conversely, if your HKID gives you ROA but DOES NOT have the *** THEN YOU NEED TO RETURN TO HK EVERY 36 MONTHS TO RENEW YOUR FULL ROA - FAILURE TO DO SO WILL DOWNGRADE YOUR ROA TO RTL.

But the Director of Immigration can determine whether an individual ""has ceased to be ordinarily resident in Hong Kong or is only temporarily absent"" through factors such as employment by a Hong Kong-based company and the whereabouts of principal family members.

Re: Covid Testing Required For All Flying From HK to the US,"I would contact your airline directly to find out what they will require for your boarding in Saigon and in Hong Kong, though it's so early in the release of this CDC directive and the actual requirement doesn't begin until 5 January, it may be a few days before these gray areas are sorted out by the airlines. The wording in the CDC directive is ""flights to the United States originating from the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau. "" Several websites define an ""originating flight"" as ""First flight of an itinerary, the top most flight listed on a ticket."" So in your case, assuming both flights were purchased on one ticket, the flight originates in Saigon not in Hong Kong and as long as you stay airside and not enter Hong Kong through immigration you likely shouldn't need to do testing. But only your airline can tell you for sure what they expect of you; and if the flights are purchased on one ticket not bought as separate flights may make a difference, where a flight purchased separately from Hong Kong to the USA may very likely be considered an originating flight, but that's just my speculation."

If they are unable to check the luggage straight through we will only have 2 hours 50 mins to collect our luggage and check in for the next flight. This is also dependent on the flight being on time!

That leaves about an hour margin. If your flight arrives on time, that's fine. If your flight is an hour late, you may not be able to make your connection and you will have to buy a new, possibly very expensive ticket.

You basically have a couple options of things you can do in that little of time. 1) Airport Express (24 min) to Hong Kong Station, walk around Central, have a quick look at the harbour, have a quick dim sum and then get back to the airport. 2) Taxi (10-15 min) to Tung Chung, take the Ngong Ping 360 cable car up to the Ngong Ping village on Lantau, have a brief look at the Big Buddha than take a taxi from the village back to the airport or cable car back down to Tung Chung depending on how much time you have left, have a look around CityGate shopping mall, then taxi back to the airport. Note that the cable car starts running at 10am. Also, you mention coming in about 2 weeks, if this is the weekend leading into Chinese New Year, it could potentially be crowded and not recommended activity with such a short layover.

Golden Bus over the HKMB bridge has increased frequency of journeys and there are few private bus charters from Kowloon to Cotai Strip (Macau) but the regular ferry service that has been paused for the past 3 years are not yet authorised to resume service to/from Macau. As such, travel to Macau now and in the immediate future is possible but may be a time consuming, logistically slow and frustrating endeavour that will require planning, patience and a real desire to endure all in order to visit our sister SAR.

Trail recommendations are also very much dependant on where you staying in HK, how much time you have available, your hiking experience, shape and fitness, what gear you have with you (proper shoes, hiking sticks). It is also important to know how familiar you are with getting around Hong Kong. Some of our very best trails are on Lantau Island and up in the New Territories which require using local buses to get as close to trailheads. This is usually easy for those familiar with getting around HK but not so much for tourists. So if you can fill us in with the above, we can offer some trails that you might find appealing while here."

I agree that regardless of where one is flying to, if you are thinking about a layover in HK for a few hours, you definitely want to understand what impact (if any) this will have on your final arrival destination. I believe the UK is remaining HK friendly in this manner but things could change quickly if we encounter a huge wave of infections once the border opens up with the mainland this coming Sunday (8 Jan 2023). Many are expecting that to happen here locally along with another massive way post Chinese New Year as border crossing may start to resemble the insane migration scenes of the past depending on how the daily crossing quotas are treated.

Then you can in the morning go to the Buddha (cable car up and down, or bus one way and cable car the other way is another interesting option), afternoon MTR to TST, and when you're tired MTR back to Tung Chung, collect your luggage, and then a taxi from there to your Disneyland hotel. The Disney hotels are quite far from the Disneyland MTR station. From Tung Chung you'd take MTR to Sunny Bay, change to the Disneyland Resort Line, and then at Disney station change to a shuttle bus. Perfectly doable of course but taxi is much easier and faster on this route.

I have searched the forum but lots of threads are old or left me with some questions so hopefully I can find some answers here. We fly UK to Australia with Cathay on a through ticket and will arrive in HK at 8am and fly out again 10pm. Our plan at the moment is the 360 Cable Car to Budda, then into centre. I have been to HK once before about 30 years ago. 1. It looks like the Cable Car runs 10-6 so will probably go there first and hope to get on as soon as it opens. May mean hanging around for an hour but I guess thats better as it will be a waste to travel to and from Central later on in the day to do it. How long for Cable Car there and back and a wander around at the top, was thinking about a couple of hours? 2. . Airport Express - Is this the quickest option into Central, so we would be best going back to Airport from Tung Chung after the cable car and catching Airport Express? 3. City - Probably head over to Island on Ferry first and get something to eat then go up Peak and wander round parks/temple and Ding Ding if enough time. Then back to Kowloon early evening for something to eat, wander along waterfront and up Nathan Rd a bit then back to Airport for about 8pm. 4. Octopus Card - bit confused by this. It is worth getting these and if so it there any advantage to the loan ones or the mobile app. 3 of us travelling so will need one each or should we just use credit cards. 5. Cash - do we need cash? Rarely carry cash these days but I read somewhere Star Ferry is cash only and maybe that also applies to some food stalls and some other things? Any other recommendations for things we should try and see/do in HK or if we are making any unknowing errors with the outline plan? Should we pre-book things like Cable Car and Peak Tram (or just get bus up Peak if queue is long). I may just book the cable car as if we don't get much rest on the plane over we will be shattered and scale back what we can do in HK. Thanks"

Credit card doesn't work for public transport. Many small restaurants do not take credit cards; they're far more likely to take octopus for payments. Star Ferry takes cash or Octopus. You can use credit card to pay for the cable car, the Peak Tram and Airport Express, all other public transit is cash (usually no change given) or Octopus."

Airlines were abruptly banned from operating flights to HK for two weeks if they inadvertently allowed passengers onboard who tested COVID-positive on arrival. This threw the airlines' operational planning into a tizzy. Many airlines (and not just Cathay) were affected by this. However, HK is Cathay's base and it was most affected by this. Fortunately, ""getting on the same page as the mainland"" now means rapidly opening up and that is what HK is doing.

The food tour leaders in the past sort of protected the names of the establishments/food shops they would take guests so as not to give away their tour path, details (and business). The person I knew who was into leading food tours stopped due to the pandemic and having no guests, had to pay the bills so they moved on to another line of work and job. Some online magazines like Time Out, Sassy and the likes highlight restaurants, coffee shops and foods to try in various districts around the city but much of what they promote is paid for advertising and from what I've experienced of their highlighted places, some are good, others are not. Similarly, there used to be travel blogger food recommendations in HK that while somewhat random and other times almost copycat in fashion, weren't bad lists of places to try. Not sure if these are still around and online but could be worth a search online. Last problem is that quite a few places went out of business during the pandemic, even some of our legacy restaurants, bakeries and old time favourites. Others have moved locations around the city as well. As such, older food trails you might come across online might need a good spot check to make sure places are still in business and located at the same place. On the bright side, while many places closed during the pandemic, many more opened or in the case of Little Bao in Sheung Wan, for example, reopened. One of the interesting developments during the pandemic was the surprising number of modern, urban coffee shops have popped pretty much throughout the city, in fairly great numbers and in interesting spots one might not have expected 5 years ago. For years, Sham Shui Po has seen probably 20 coffee shops that have opened, mostly between Boundary and Nam Chong Street in the past 3-4 years. As such, I'm not certain how confident I'd even be in food trail lists and suggestions around the city. Some might remain relevant, others perhaps not. If you do come across something that looks interesting, feel free to post it here and some of us who support the forum can have a look at it. Or if through research, you come up with foods/places on your own that you are interested in trying, do the same. Post it here and we can spot check it for you. Good luck with your food/drink/restaurant research in HK."

A few places like the Ladies Market in Mongkok took big hit during the pandemic and changed with stall keepers pivoting to selling low-cost consumables and every day items that locals might want to buy instead of tourist trinkets and souvenirs. That may revert back in time but it will probably take a while. Other attractions like the 1 hour Star Ferry harbour cruise stopped during the pandemic.

Re: HK tourist scene,"@wvmarle Out of curiosity, we passed by the tram stations yesterday (Sat 23 Jan 2023) and were surprised to find rather full trams leaving the lower terminus late morning. This compared to a couple months ago when it was just a handful of locals trying out the new 6th generation trams definitely indicates that tourists are back and starting to congregate around our top attractions again. What I did notice is at the Lower Tram, there seems to be a slow by steady number of people entering and making it through the till where a queue is forming for the next available tram. Still nowhere near the long queues of yesteryears but there were some short queues forming. At the Upper Terminus we went ahead and entered to ride back down. There were no queues to enter the boarding area and perhaps 40 people on the platform waiting for the tram when it arrived for boarding. The ride back down had many empty seats. This wasn't surprising as it was always quicker to board and fewer passengers going back down compared to the ride up. When I took the Peak Tram last in November, probably 25 people on the way up and less than 10 of us on the way down. Anyway, it is interesting to see the difference two months makes when it comes to tourist numbers and activity on the Peak Tram. I've noticed similar rise in passenger traffic on the Star Ferry this month and am already dreading the shoulder-to-shoulder conditions on the Ave. of Stars returning at some point. It has been so nice walking the promenade in the evenings the past few years. That will likely change sooner than later this year as visitor numbers continue to pick up."

If so, that could take quite a chunk out of the time you have available. Even if you don't have to worry about your luggage you'll still have to pass through customs and security when you leave and re-enter the airport and on the way back that will be quite late at night, so with two young kids to sort out, I'd allow a couple of hours to avoid any last minute rushing or panics. My advice would definitely be not to try to do too much. One suggestion would be to get a bus from the airport to Tung Chung and then take the cable car up to Ngong Ping. If you have the energy you can climb the 268 steps up to the Big Buddha, have a mooch around the shops in the village and, as sunset won't be until about 6.30pm in April, you would even have time to walk one of the shorter Lantau Peak trails - the Wisdom Path and Tree Trail should only take about half an hour.

Probably best to just take a photo of the negative RAT test with your name, date and time of test penciled on the cartridge. If you are asked to show it to the airline taking you to HK you'll have it. Same if you are asked in HK. Probably doesn't hurt to download that photo to your laptop in case your phone battery is dead for some reason when you arrive. As another backup, just carry an extra test with your as back-up so you could simply take it at the airport if all your tech goes kaput and someone wants to see a negative test result."

You can do so at Tai Wai near the beginning of the trail and Shing Mun River. It is just a few minutes walk from the MTR Station. There are also bike rentals at the Bike Park which is closer to Tai Shui Hang MTR Station or in Sha Tin Park, which is across the river near Sha Tin MTR Station. {I would also love to hike Ma On Shan, just wondering is there a hike all the way to Sai Kung?} Actually yes. You can hike quite a few places in Ma On Shan country Park starting on the promenade side cutting across the park and ending in Sai Kung. I particularly like hiking the Hunchbacks, a gorgeous series of peaks with excellent panoramic views. You can include Ma On Shan Peak, one of HK's highest or places like Ngong Ping where paragliders sail along the ridge line before descending down to Sai Kung village. If you mean to Sai Kung West Country Park, yes, you can hike the MacLehose trail stage 4 through Ma On Shan. It ends at the northeast boundary and Sai Sha Road which is where the Stage 3 begins. This stage transects Sai Kung West Country Park and ends at Pak Tam Au. I wouldn't try combining these two in one day though unless you are in serious hiking shape and condition. One stage is well enough for a single day's hike if you ask me. https://www.alltrails.com/parks/hong-kong/sai-kung/ma-on-shan-country-park Hope this is helpful."

Re: Tai Long Wan Hike,"My only add would be based on what time of day you wanting to hike and if you are going on weekend or not. If early morning on weekend, I'd go with the taxi as public buses run less regular into the park early on. I like hitting the beaches there before the crowds show up (9-10am) and if the weather is fairly nice, they will start showing up by late morning even during the cooler months. Also note, that transportation out of Sai Kung East on weekends can be a bit hectic. As there will many hikers trying to exit the park from mid to late evening onward and transportation is somewhat limited. We've sat at the bus stop near Pak Tam Au for long waits as one full bus after another goes by. For this reason, I'd recommend loading the HK Taxi app (see link below) to your phone (if you are a data plan) so that you can arrange transport out of the park if the queues at the bus stands are too much https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cornermation.calltaxi&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1 Another great way to exit country park after the Tai Long Wan trail if the sea conditions are good is to take speed boat from Sai Wan or Ham Tin beach back to Sai Kung village (see review below with details of the speedboat option). https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d2003133-r787533938-Tai_Long_Wan-Hong_Kong.html Sai Kung is a fun seaside village with good restaurants, coffee shops a few bars as well.

You can then take the 360 cable car back down to Tung Chung as long as time is playing in your favour. From there quick taxi or bus back to the airport and you are good to go. If your time is a bit short after seeing the Big Buddha, then just grab a taxi from the village directly back to the airport."

If everything goes smoothly, you should still have at least 3 hours before your flight. Find a restaurant at the Citygate Outlet Mall as it offers more choices than dining at the airport. You can buy an Octopus at the airport station though when you surrender the card, you will need to pay a small handling fee in order to get back any unused credit."

That leaves just over an hour to get through security and immigration, which is normally enough. So up to three hours up there which is nice. Time for a meal as well. The only thing I'm concerned about is that when HKIA gets more passengers that the normally smooth security and baggage handling breaks down like we've seen in Europe. Time will tell whether they can get enough staff fast enough to deal with this. Do keep an eye out on e.g. this forum closer to your planned trip date.

Rode the tram, ate dinner , did touristy stuff. Came back to the airport before midnight. Went through security - didn't have bags as Cathy nicely kept them for us - and at that time - they had lounge chairs that were sleepable. So we were lucky to find two together and we slept on them. They were close to a bathroom and food court. This was PRE COVID. Today. Who knows the deal. But a night in the HK is doable for sure. No one approached us. Another time I had the same deal. In on cathay at night. Next flight was the 10am to shanghai. Walked around the airport. Ate food. Walked around more. Free carts so it's easy."

There may be enough time to make this happen but if for some reason you miss transportation back from Macau, you will miss your outbound flight out of HK as well. As such the risk is generally considered too high compared to just enjoying your day here in Hong Kong. Best to just enjoy a day in Hong Kong and save Macau for another trip when you can explore our sister city more thoroughly. There is quite a lot to do/see there now compared to 15-20 years ago. Its worth 2-3 days to visit well."

With your arrival time, luggage check immigration, transport, etc you can xpect to arrive in your Macau hotel a little before midnight. You'll have to leave your hotel latest 13:00 the next day, better leave noon or earlier as you're not familiar with transport so need more of a buffer. Expect 2-2.5 hrs travel from leaving your hotel to arriving at HKIA if all goes smoothly. So that gives you a night starting midnight and a very early morning in Macau. With those hours you may consider to forego the hotel and just hang out in the casinos until it's light enough outdoors to go and see some of the heritage sights... if you have the energy for a schedule that grueling."

There are no local testing requirements to enter or re-enter the airport to fly out of Hong Kong. The only HK gov testing requirement which remains is for inbound travellers (from Taiwan or outside of China) to have a self-administered RAT test within 24 hours or PCR test within 48 hours of their original departure to Hong Kong. As such, if you are making a connection and want to do a day out in HK, you do need to meet the same testing requirements for arriving inbound passengers mentioned above.

The problem with wild animals is that you just never know if/when you'll see them. Sometimes they seem to be everywhere and then you do the same hike the next day and you won't see a single one. Now with our feral cows, less interesting seeing than wild pigs, but there are predictable locations in the New Territories and Lantau where you are most likely going to encounter some while out on hikes. Then you have the macaques. There are places like Monkey Mountain mentioned above and Shing Mun Reservoir where you are pretty much guaranteed to see them and in great numbers."

Re: A week in Hong Kong - as travellers n not sightseers,"Day 1 Must do as you land in HK: BUY an OCTOPUS card as life cannot move ahead without one. The only drawback is that its not so east to top it up :( Only via cash. After a good Vietnamese lunch, we walked to the Wan Chai waterfront and caught the ferry to Tsim Sha Tsui. Enjoyed walking thru the waterfront, HK Cultural Centre and the attractive stores. A little off the main market, we saw a lane full ot florists with the most gorgeous flowers. Lucky to witness a concert underway featuring a leading Singapore singer. The atmosphere inspite of the rains was electric. Day 2 Started with our re education of HK. Visited one of the largest temple complex in the island territory. Wong Tan Sin. Beautiful, clean n peaceful. Quintessential of HK. Worshippers of elements of nature. The public transport system is impeccable. You can reach any corner of the island by buses n the metro. On time to the T, no cash, payment by their local card The Octopus We took the bus to the south east end of New Territories to visit friends who live amidst greenery, gently sloping hills, pleasing bays n cool climes which may make you camp there forever n never leave their Hang Hau village. A long drive with them thru the New Territories took us close to Schenzen border; we only saw tree covered mountains, abundant nature parks with hardly any traffic. The views of the ocean are stunning. After a lunch consisting of varied local street food, dinner was elaborate at the Yacht Club. If you can find a member to take you, add it to your to do list :)"

Evening was spent walking aroung the base, bar hopping as we tried the different crafts beers brewed locally. Day 4 Visit to Lama Island and the trek across Yung Shue Wan to Sok Kwu Wan We took an early morning ferry, Gorgeous weather was the secret ingredient of the trek across the island. Took as about 3 hours with all the photo ops n stoping to take in the various sights. Lunch od fresh seafood catch was the icing on the cake!! We returned bk not to Wan chai but Aberdeen, Walk along the Promenade was interesting and figuring out a bus to return to Wan Chai even more. Bauses are frequent and work on the principle of one price n get off wherever you want or so we felt Day 5 As it was a clear day, we decided to do an educative historic simple trek. Lung Yeuk Tau Heritage Trail. Armed with a map found on a blog, we followed the recommended trail n educated ourselves with HK history. Afternoon waas the Thousand Buddhas Monastery with the evening spent in Wan Chai street markets n the Queens Boulevard."

Day 7 Having heard so much about the marine parks in HK, we felt we couldnt leave without visiting one. What a day to choose to do so! It was raining non stop. We needed 3 changes (metro n bus) to reach our destination Hoi Ha Wan Marine Park in Sai Kung. Beautiful spot to be enjoyed in good weather. But we decided to make the mosyt of it n within half hour, the skies cleared and we enjoyed the rugged trek of 3.7 miles from Hoi Ha to Tan Tai. A must for the outdoorsy folks.

Also, once I get to Macau it will likely be well after midnight so do the free shuttles to the casinos run 24 hours or can I rely on a taxi that late?

Re: HKIA to Macau late at night via bus,"The HZMB is open 24 hours a day and the Golden Shuttles will run on reduced schedule for overnight journeys between HK & Macau so you can definitely use this form of transportation to make way to go straight to Macau. On the Macau side, there are public buses 101X (Macau Peninsula) and 102X (Taipa and Cotai Strip) - both cost MOP$6 that run 24 hours a day. You can pay with HKD coins. There are taxis on the Macau side as well and they should be available 24 hours a day although I've not used one at overnight hours since Macau has reopened so can't 100% confirm that there will be many waiting at overnight hours. The free hotel shuttle buses don't run 24 hours a day even from the ferry terminals so you would want to go with a public bus or taxi if going straight over during overnight hours.

Re: Sun Ferrt formerly New World First Ferry,"The government supported HK$2 fare still applies to users of Elder Octopus at the current time.

HK residents will be eligible via JoyYou card which is currently in the course of being rolled out in phases to HK residents age 60 and over or Personalised Octopus. At some future date to be announced (probably when roll out of the JoyYou card has been completed later this year) the $2 concession will be withdrawn from Elder Octopus. I believe that from that time the concession provided by the anonymous Elder Octopus will then revert to pre-$2 fare terms and be limited to the transport operators own concession, usually 50% of full adult fare for passengers age 65 and over. The fact that NWFF has been taken over by Sun Ferry (CKS Shipping) doesn't have any bearing on the situation."

No further restrictions upon arrival. The Government recommends all inbound persons to conduct daily RATs using self-arranged rapid antigen test (RAT) kits during the period between the day of arrival (i.e. Day 0) and Day 5 after arrival at Hong Kong.""

I would like to visit the Peak with the tram, Lantau (Big Buddha + the surrounding area) and Macau. What is the best way to do this? I suspect probably best to head straight to the Peak (on Sunday it opens early) but the downside is that it would be the busiest time of the day (Sunday morning). Reserving tickets in advance is not clear to me I gain a massive advantage while at the same time I confine myself within a time slot and if there are any delays with my flight I might miss my slot. If then I take the Ngong Ping 360 tram is there a way to continue from Lantau my journey to Macau or do I have to come back to HK and from there take a bus (?) to Macau? It appears that there is also a bus straight from the Airport to Macau, which could be another option but I think I probably prefer Macau during the night to enjoy the casino lights.... Talking about casinos, am I allowed to enter with jeans and trainers (or even shorts)? suspect not..

Re: HK layover: Peak, Big Buddha, Macau - best way to do it all","Well you should plan to exit the airport around 08:30, and I guess you need to be back there at 23:00. The Peak is a hill - it never closes. The Peak Tram starts at 7am; there's no advantage to pre-booking a ticket. The Peak Tower is simply a tourist trap - it holds no attraction that I can see - the same views are free from the Lions Pavilion or the walk around Lugard/Harlech Roads. The NgongPing 360 is a cable car in the English sense (i.e. an aerial ropeway), not a tram. Sadly it only runs from 10:00 - 18:00. Which is not ideal with your schedule and requirements, at least from the perspective of taking it upwards. I think the only sensible way to combine these three things is: 1) Get a taxi from the airport to either the Buddha (in which case you'll need to get a blue taxi at the airport), or to Tung Chung (any taxi) and then get the #23 bus to the Buddha (probably the 09:10 departure). This will get you to the Buddha around 10am via great views (on a clear day) around Lantau Island. Spend maybe an hour there, and get the Cable Car back down to Tung Chung at around 11:00. 2) Take the MTR from Tung Chung to Hong Kong Station. Exit to the Ferry Piers. Take a quick round trip on the Star Ferry from Pier 7 to TST and back, maybe with a few minutes admiring the iconic HK skyline view from the TST waterfront in between. 3) Back at HK Ferry Piers if the timing fits (it goes on the hour and half hour currently) take bus 15C to the lower Peak Tram terminus, otherwise, assuming you can use a map, simply walk - it's about 1.5km, 4) (I guess it's about 13:00 now) Get the Peak Tram uphill. At the top either (quicker) go to the Lions Pavilion for the iconic view, or take the ~4km flat walk around the Peak on Lugard and Harlech Roads, getting a more varied selection of views. 5) Get bus #15 from the bus station at the Peak, and, if possible, get the front row upstairs seat, for the ride back down all the way to the end point at Central Pier 5. 6) (I guess about 16:00 now) Walk to the Macau ferry terminus. You will need to have booked a ferry well in advance - weekend ferries are all sold out these days. Note that if you miss the ferry you booked on then your ticket is no longer valid, but if you arrive early you can standby for earlier ferries. The schedule is changing rapidly as the route reopens. As it stands today I'd say book the 17:30 ferry. 7) Get to Macau at 18:30; immigration etc; then a taxi or shuttle bus to, say, The Venetian (pick one casino - you don't have time for anything more). Get there maybe 19:15-19:30. 8) You need to get a bus back to the airport - the ferries between Macau and the airport are running literally 3 times per WEEK at the the moment). I have less knowledge in this area. But I guess you might need to leave the casino at around 21:00 latest to get back to HK Airport for 23:00 (again, immigration - you need to reenter HK, you can't go direct from Macau to HK Airport airside by bus). Others can advise more on this. Overall, if you're essentially box-ticking then this is doable. It's not how I would choose to spend a day here though. Edited: 1 year ago"

In short, you won't really have much time there to do/see much of anything before having to make your way back to HK so that you can make it to the airport in time for your connection flight. And if there is a typhoon or delayed ferries/buses... well, you are in trouble. In short, you are simply taking risk for the sake of doing so by trying to squeeze in Macau during layovers.

There wasn't a single day which was sold out in the next 90 days in which it's possible to book.

Re: Hotel with Club access,"Hello SonicYouth, For some reason probably 2/3 of my post #2 is missing and that probably causes some confusion. I didn't notice the chopped off response and am not sure how/why that happened. Oh well. Firstly, I don't disagree with your very good point about staycations at all. My post wasn't really about why there were club lounge disruptions at some hotels, it was more to make the point that it happened at various properties and that is probably a major reason you won't find any publications about our best club lounge hotel options for the past several years, not even by our local publications. What I previously thought to have mentioned in post #2 was that quite a few of our hotels, including some big names which traditionally offer club Lounges did serve as self-isolation/quarantine hotels during various cycles of the DQH scheme between 2020-2022. These, at certain cycles, even included the likes of Cordis and Langham which you are mentioned above. While serving as a DQH designated quarantine hotel, guests were strictly prohibited from leaving their rooms - and as such club lounge benefits were not just disrupted for long stretches of time, they were halted altogether, and at times for many months. Here is a write up on Timeout mentioning a few DQH properties, some of which normally have club lounges that were disrupted during those times. https://www.timeout.com/hong-kong/travel/the-best-quarantine-hotels-in-hong-kong Further, quite a few properties did pivot to function more like service apartments, offering long stay packages of 30 days or even up to 3, 6+ month stay promotions as they tried to survive during the pandemic. And this happened at some major hotel players like ICON, New World Millennium and Sheraton TST and other properties with club lounges. Anecdotally speaking, I can share a friend's experience. He stayed at a five star hotel for an entire year as part of a long stay promotion and made interesting observations about the club lounge service and food which he adamantly claimed to have changed fairly noticeable after a few months as most guests had become more like residents instead of hotel guests. After complaining about the waning club lounge service and experience, he was compensated in the form of free dinner vouchers at the hotel restaurants for the remaining months of his stay. I joined him for one such meal and had no reason to not believe the account regarding the disrupted club lounge experiences. In many ways, it made sense to me given how desperate many hotels had become to cut costs and pay the bills during the pandemic. Anyway, like mentioned above, I don't disagree with your very good point about the staycation packages. I just wanted to add the specifics that were somehow chopped off my post (#2) above. I think it probably helps explain what I had thought to have posted previously. As I wanted to say in that post as well, Things are getting better....... for our local hotels now so hopefully club lounges, gyms, pools, restaurants and other related disruptions are long in the rear view mirror and we can see properties return to pre-pandemic states if possible and as soon as possible."

Besides, you should also make some allowance for traffic incidents. My advice is don't stay in the city longer than 8 hours. It is always better safe than sorry."

Re: First time in Hongkong advice please,"{ Kindly suggest a few goor hotels for family's with either interconnected rooms or family room for a budget of £150-£200 gbp per night or around that budget. } Make sure you read previous forum posts. This question (family of four needing a room in HK) has been asked many times over the years and hotel recommendations within those threads remain relevant in 2023. You can do this by using the Search Box near the top of the forum. I would also suggest using Booking.com (BC) to get a look what properties which are available during the dates of your intended visit. BC has a good feel of the hotel scene in Hong Kong, most reputable properties in the city offer rooms on that platform so you can use it to get an idea for which properties are in your price range and where they are located around the city. {Which are the convinient areas to stay for using public transport etc? } Most recommend staying in hotels within close proximity to MTR Stations. Our local rail system is by far the most tourist friendly means of transportation. Buses can fill in the gaps where the MTR doesn't work out best.Popular areas are in various districts around HK Island and the Kowloon Peninsula. {I see we have to do daily antigen tests recommended? Looks like hongkong is the odd one out which hasn't phased out mandatory covid testing?} Lucky for you. There are no mandatory daily testing requirements now. Local gov't in HK only recommends that you do daily testing but you don't have to take daily tests any longer if you don't want to.

This means things will continue to change locally as we revert back to pre-pandemic conditions in the city. Have noticed some effects of increased tourist activity in recent weeks. Would be interested to hear what others are seeing/experiencing that might be worth visitors to the city being aware of. The Peak Tram is now regularly full up, at least on the two weekday visits made over the past month. While there is still not much of a queue, the trams themselves are filling up with picture taking tourists. Star Ferry riders are increasing but still no issue of getting a good seat if not an entire row to yourself. Harbour Cruise is definitely back on. The booth at the TST Ferry Pier which I hadn't seen open or a couple years is now regularly staffed and selling rides. Helicopter ride shop on the upper deck, selling the harbour flights is back open as well. Avenue of Stars - lined with tourist groups again. I admit having really enjoyed the lack of crowds here of the past three years, a rare silver lining of the pandemic. While shoulder crushing crowds are still not back, even midweek afternoon walks here have returned to what I would call crowded conditions. Country Parks - Not many come here to hike our country parks but for those who do, we are definitely seeing fewer hikers on the trails even during weekend hikes this spring. This is likely the result of HKers now being able to travel out of the city this year instead of being stuck here looking for things to do every weekend. My guess around 66-75% hiker numbers this Spring compared to what we experienced the past few spring seasons. HKMB - Last week, I encountered queues to board the Golden Bus that I haven't seen since 2018. I was really surprised to see so many making the midweek journey over to Macau already. Not a major issue though as multiple Golden Shuttle Buses were being loading simultaneously and they were departing leaving few minutes to Macau so while the queues were long, the passenger processing was very fast. Speaking of Macau, the city is ahead of HK with tourist visitors so far - seeing roughly 1.56 million visitors in Feb (44% pre-pandemic levels), packed into much more confined space. Any thoughts of visiting there before the crowds return - that window of opportunity has already passed. Do be ready for crowds in the main tourist areas around the peninsula and long queues at the famous food shops. The Cotai Strip on the other hand isn't particularly crowded by comparison to pre-pandemic levels. I believe this is much to do with several major properties opening (Galaxy Phase II, Lisboa Grand Palace, Lisboeta) during the pandemic and others reopening (Sands Cotai Central rebranded and reopened as Londoner). This has definitely helped spread tourists around more than in the past. However, once Macau climbs back up to 75%+ pre-pandemic figures, these casinos and properties will likely fill up with crowds again as well. Taipa village - Very crowded again, especially the food shops."

Here are a few that will A few tourist friendly places with English menus that stick out more than others include Dim Sum Square (Sheung Wan), Dim Dim Sum (Mongkok, Jordan and Wan Chai), One Dim Sum (Prince Edward) More traditional you can go with Maxim's Palace. They have several branches, the one at Hong Kong City Hall is most notable. More of a teahouse with good dim sum experience - Lock Cha (HK Park, Tai Kwan in Central) More modern take - try Dim Sum Library (Admiralty, Austin-TST) There are actually so many, its hard to list them out without missing other very good places for dim sum.

Re: hong kong 5 days trip,"{hotel - BP ,regal , metro park ( which one better)} Do be aware that Regal and Metropark each have several hotels around the city. Make sure which one you are viewing and thinking about before booking. Which is best along with BP (Austin Rd in TST) depends on what area of the city you want to stay, how much you want to spend and what room type is most appealing for you and your group of three. I'd look over each on booking.com to see the room types and specs. Consider proximity to MTR Stations as well. @wvmarle {Note that Mongkok is currently still a shadow of its former self due to the drop in tourists around, it is hard to predict how it will be come August.} Passed by last Friday late afternoon and found a noticeable improvement to the situation at Ladies Market. Still some gaps where stalls are not setting up but some are reverting back to selling tourist souvenirs and trinkets. And, definitely some tourists walking around, doing a bit of browsing..... but yes, still nothing like what the scene was here in past years. Will take a while to get back to normal. @3 {buddha and tai o in same day? how about 360 ?} Yes that is fine. You can visit the Big Buddha by way of the 360 Cable Car ride. Most start in Tung Chung and ride the cable car up to the Ngong Ping Village and Big Buddha. Expect queues if you go this way. Alternative is to take bus or taxi up the village and ride the 360 cable car back down instead, fewer take this approach. Obviously, you ride both ways as well if you want to but that will take up more time and limit your ability to also go out to Tai O afterwards. {peak tram can make it on day 4 shopping am i right?} That makes a lot of sense to me, especially if you are planning to do a lot of shopping in places like Causeway Bay or other districts on HK Island. Perhaps do the Peak Tram first thing in the morning before queues form or go later in the day after your shopping when time isn't a factor. The Peak Tram presently runs until 10pm and you can take taxi down even much later if you are up at the Peak very late."

Re: hong kong 5 days trip,">>>>big Buddha only stairs right?>>>> The Big Buddha is accessible via a long flight of steps; https://flic.kr/p/247Ci3g There is a car park just beneath the podium at the top of these stairs which allows access by wheelchair or short set of steps to the lower podium level of the Buddha, avoiding the main steps; https://flic.kr/p/daE6kB Prior to the pandemic there were some some tours to the Buddha and other Lantau attractions which were allowed to use this car park enabling easy access to the Buddha. However, since tourism recently resumed I can't find any such tours currently operating which use this car park. Most tours to the Buddha aren't allowed to use this car park and park near the bus terminus which means visitors need to use the main steps. Some years ago Po Lin Monastery adjoining the Buddha site would on request and subject to availability arrange transport to the car park for people with mobility problems (in a buggy I think) but I don't know whether this arrangement still exits.

I did a search and minimum $100+ night for 3/4 star hotel..} I'm afraid so. And sadly, quite a few midrange properties that I was familiar with went out of business or are pivoting to become serviced apartments now so the supply in that range is less than pre-pandemic times as well. If you are finding something at SGD$100(?) a night (HKD$586) for a 3 star place, that is not a bad price now at all, especially if you are looking at centrally located properties. Disney is easy to coordinate a day visit. Macau - more or less but do expect a long day (2-2.5 hr - travel & immigration) each way. Ferry services are proving slower to ramp up but bus service at the HZMB is full tilt already, steady stream of travellers going in both directions. Service on the bridge is 24 hours a day as well."

The sub $100 are generally with bad reviews.} High end properties, which you don't seem to be considering, offer more predictable quality experiences and hence can be easily recommended. As for our cheaper places... No unfortunately I don't have personal recommendations right at this time. The fact is many lower end hotels took a beating during the pandemic, quite a few did everything they could to survive, operating on skeleton staff and letting their service go down the tubes along the way. That are remain are trying to claw back and return to being viable properties but that means that there are no guarantees for what one might experience in 2023 being similar to pre-pandemic days. Best to read up on recent reviews (TA, booking.com, google reviews) on properties that you are most interested in and make a decision. If you have places that look like they fit your requirements, feel free to post them here and forum regulars can offer their thoughts if they have any. {Which is more convenient and faster? Bus or ferry?} Most convenient will depend on what hotel you are staying at. If you are right next to a ferry terminal, then ferry is more convenient. If not, Bus might be more convenient. Bus transportation is continuous and non-stop so you can go when you feel like it, not restricted to ferry departure times. That is why I generally prefer the bus. The bus is much cheaper than ferry rides as well, if that is an important consideration. {What are some of the places to visit/ shop or eat?} Research on Discover Hong Kong for sightseeing and attractions here in the city. That is a good place to start for learning about places to visit. Shopping is very personal, only you know what you are interested in shopping for. Use google and look for business and brand names you fancy and you'll be able to quickly locate their shops around the city. Where to eat? Wow... Ten thousand ways to answer this question. You'll find many more restaurants here than you can eat at in a lifetime. Again, it all depends on your personal tastes, preferences and how much you want to spend. You can go cheap or very expensive fine dining. You can eat local Cantonese, Asian, Western and everything in between. @minxbaby {Some of the attractions are still on reduced operating hours.

Ferries from the HK Macau ferry terminal go to the Outer Harbour ferry terminal in Macau which is on the main Macau Peninsula. That is where you can walk to take a short bus ride over to the World Heritage area including the Ruins of St. Pauls. Spending HKD in Macau is easiest. Everyone (incl. public buses) accepts HKD but will most likely give you MOP in change if making smaller purchases. Do note that that the Macau LRT self-ticketing machines don't accept HKD. If you end up using the LRT and only have HKD, that is still fine, just go to the ticket booth and buy from there. Otherwise, you will have problem using HKD in Macau. Your bigger problem is getting rid of your MOP upon leaving. This is one of the world's least convertible currencies, not even easy to exchange in Hong Kong. So make sure you spend as much of it as you can before returning to HK. Lord Stow's Do note that Lord Stow's isn't on the Macau Peninsula. There original bakery is down in the south of Macau in the village of Caloane. They have branches in Taipa village and at Venetian Hotel on the Cotai Strip that are convenient to visit. I don't know what the queue situation will be like in November but it is NUTS right now with mainland Chinese exercising three years of pent up demand, forming very long queues outside Lord Stows and other famous food shops and purchasing huge amounts. I was able to get into Lord Stow's in Taipa village on a visit earlier this month by going shortly after they opened on a weekday. The queue was just 15 minutes then. At other times of the day, the queue was much, much longer and this was just a weekday. Again, by Nov things may settle down a bit..... Portugalia Portugália in Taipa Village has closed down their present location but have announced on facebook that they are reopening nearby soon. So do check for address update before your trip in November. It will be different than what you see now."

Under normal traffic conditions a taxi should take about 30 mins from Ocean Terminal or about 40 mins from Kai Tak to the airport passenger terminal. However, its difficult to predict with certainty whether you would have adequate time as this would depend on actual time taken for the disembarkation process and availability of transport. I think you would need to arrive at the airport at least an hour before flight departure time. I'm not sure what the current situation is but since its opening in 2013 until its closure during the covid pandemic Kai Tak Cruise Terminal was notorious for lack of taxi availability on ship call days and it may be advisable to pre-book a taxi. Cruise lines or the port authority have in the past arranged shuttle coaches for arriving passengers to transfer from Kai Tak to the Airport Express Kowloon Station which is a 20-minute train journey to the airport but I'm not sure what the current situation is (mention of this appears to have disappeared from the cruise terminal website).

Re: Revisiting Hong Kong,"{Am considering between Park Hotel & Royal Plaza, may I check which has better access to more nice food options, night markets, malls? I am open to suggestion of similar range hotels too.} It is a fair comparison. Both are close to endless food and restaurant options. Royal Plaza is closer to a swath of cheap eats places and night market action in Mongkok. What I really like about this property now is that it is connected directly to the East Rail Line which is now extended all the way to HK Island (stated in 2022). You can be in Admiralty MRT Station on HK Island in just 20 minutes from the hotel. For me that is a game changer compared to the past. Park Hotel is closer to the bigger malls in TST and closer to the TST promenade where you find the Ave of Stars and lovely views of the Hong Kong Island Skyline and Victoria Harbour. {What are the recommend pastries or cookies not to be missed to buy home?} Obviously mooncakes but they won't be readily available until early August when Mid-Autumn Festival season starts. Wife cakes are easy to get year round. Mainland tourists are hell bent on Jenny Bakery butter cookies and are back to queuing up outside their shop in TST to purchase boxes to take back home. To be honest, they are just ok in my opinion. There are other local bakeries like Cookies Quartet if you want local butter cookies and there won't be a queue to get into their shops. If you try this shop, buy a package of their cinnamon twists. They are wicked good, great for dipping in coffee as well. Egg tarts are very popular but not something you should take back to Singapore, they should be eaten on the day. Proper local egg tarts can be found at many simple bakeries and eateries around the city. A recent gem that emerged during pandemic days is the sour dough egg tarts from bakehouse. They have 5-6 bakeries around the city and there are queues into much of the day at all their branches to buy their newly famous egg tarts. Fun to try and pretty darn good. Again, need to eat them on the day if possible or the next morning in your hotel. Don't bother trying to take them back home with you, they won't last."

Re: Where in HK should I stay if I'm going to the M+ Museum?,"{if I'm going to the M+ Museum for 2 days?} Is there a specific reason why you want to allocate two full days to M+? I hold M+ in higher regard than many and have visited several times since the museum opened. 3/4 of a day is enough to leisurely view all of the permanent exhibitions, temporary exhibitions, take in the rooftop garden and a light meal as well. I'd also say that those not particularly keen on modern and contemporary art will probably find 1/2 a day more than enough. If you really want to spend two days in West Kowloon, might I suggest 1 day at M+ and 1 day at the Hong Kong Palace Museum, which just opened last year. It is a very good museum as well, worth 1/2 a day for the permanent collections and another 1-2 hours for temporary exhibitions. {I will be going to the M+ Museum in May and would like to know at what area/s should I look for hotels if I'm going to the M+ Museum for 2 days?} If you stay in Central/Sheung Wan area of HK Island then you can use Hong Kong Station to take the MTR over to Kowloon Station on the other side of the harbour. That is the closest walking point to the West Kowloon Cultural District. If you stay in Kowloon side, there are light green buses that make it easier to reach the Cultural district than using MTR and long walk. For example, if you stay in the TST area, light green bus 77M does pick ups outside of TST East station on Salisbury Road and outside the HK China Ferry Pier on Canton before dropping off at M+ (see link) https://www.16seats.net/eng/gmb/gk_77m.html If you stay in the Mongkok area, similarly use (route 74) https://www.16seats.net/eng/gmb/gk_74.html Here is link to the recommended transportation page for West Kowloon https://www.westkowloon.hk/en/transport"

For your hotel choices: open your favourite hotel booking site, plug in your dates and your budget, and go from there. Hotels in HK are not cheap! So you may have to up your budget to find something you like. I really don't know how many hostels have survived covid. I expect most to have closed down. Many new ones will be popping up of course as tourism recovers. Do keep in mind that many hostels call themselves ""hotel"" so do read the descriptions of accommodations and their reviews carefully before booking anything. To get to the museum, you're probably best off taking a taxi with all your equipment. They're not expensive."

Do you have any recommendation of places we can visit at the (or around) airport to have a rest? But we don't really want to spend lot of money for less than 10 hours stay.

For example, if you are wanting to stay on the Peninsula where the Ruins and rest of the World Heritage area is found, the HK-Macau Direct Bus isn't an ideal option for several reasons. It cost the same as the ferries, is less infrequent and drops off along the Cotai Strip, where you find the casinos that you seem to be less interested in seeing. This is the wrong side of Macau if you are most interested in staying and spending your 2 days on the main peninsula. There are better and less pricey transportation options if this is what you want to do. Look up the HZM bridge and Golden Shuttle bus for starters. This bridge crossing is open 24 hours a day, is very simple to use and has regular, frequent and cheaper buses running day and night that will put you right next to the main peninsula and much closer to the hotels there."

(Hi ST! 😁 Very pleased to see you and all the familiar names once again. I thought Covid and the no-Covid thing would have driven us all out.) This route may not be as difficult as you think. From the visitor center to the gate of weather station is on a narrow road with a gradual climb. You are only on ~1.5 km of it. Quite manageable. And the route to Chuen Lung, which is like (I used to consider it as ""half way to the top of Tai Mo Shan"" when I was small) not too far, on down slope, you will be fine. Take the green minibus if there is one. Or else walk out the short distance to the main road ""Route Twisk"" to take the ""big bus"" KMB."

Once you have shortlist a few, head to their website as they sometimes offer lower rates but usually with the condition that you stay for certain number of days or you have to pay upfront payment and no cancellation.

That junction (turning onto Queen's Road East) can get rather stuck but not normally at that hour. Maybe a 10-minute delay, if unlucky. The Peak Tram may have lines, you see that beforehand.

How feasible is this itinerary?,"@Randy: I am very confused by your 2 posts. In the opening, you have repeated use of ""I"" and ""my"". I thought you are a solo traveler. Then in reply #4, you said ""We are a family of 5. "" Do you have young kids? Your idea of a short-layover itinerary, taking the AE Train, Star Ferry ride, then walk along the Nathan Road north (and I presume you may walk all the way to the Kowloon Station to take the AE train back to the airport). The whole plan is like a James Bond movie plot kind of planning. If you are by yourself, you may be able to achieve it. But as a family of 5, and especially if with small children, things will take much longer and there are higher chances of unplanned issues. Such as getting a taxi which can take 5 passengers when you are walking along Nathan Road. It may take a while. Too risky with a less than 4 hour time-frame, Walking along Nathan Road really doesn't ""buy"" you much in touring experience, but adds a lot of risks in getting transportation. Walking is possible but not entirely ""family friendly"" with many streets to cross, crowded conditions, and to approach Kowloon Station there needs to be walking along some elevated walkpath and going through malls - can easily get disoriented. I would suggest you to take the AE train to Hong Kong Station. Walk outside to Central Piers. Ride the Star Ferry to Kowloon. Walk around a little waterfront promenade. But turn back to ride the Star Ferry back to Hong Kong Central Pier and ride the AE train back to the Airport from Hong Kong Station. Not attempt to use Kowloon MTR Station, either by walking there or by trying to hail a taxi mid-way along Nathan Road. If you want to take a taxi to Kowloon MTR Station, do so at the taxi stand right outside Star Ferry Terminal. Wait for a 5-passenger one. Not trying to hail one when you are walking on the street. It is very difficult (which may mean time-consuming... but time is what you don't have much of)."

It's then about a 6-700m walk to the Ibis Sheung Wan, including going up and over a bridge over Connaught Road (although I think from memory that there are lifts up to the bridge).

Even an ""average"" shop in Hong Kong would probably be better than you can find in other countries. If you don't want to pay higher price, may be just walk around the neighborhood. A lot of shops sell roast goose and other Cantonese BBQ items. It is the Cantonese specialty and you are in a place that inherited the best of the such culinary craft. Even a hole-in-the-wall may not disappoint you. You judge it with your eyes first. They all hang the roast items at the chopping counter window, which is at the front door of the eatery. See anything you like, walk in! These days they do post prices at the door or on the wall or something. You want another tip? Not sure which one to patronize? Just go to one that is most crowded with locals, but avoid the mid-day lunch hour in Central/Sheung Wan. A tidal wave of office workers eat around 12:30 pm to 2:00 pm. ."

Spend there up to 2 hours and take cable car down to Tung Chung. From there to take MTR to Kowloon. There is a small issue, that I already purchased tickets to Airport Express, so not sure if I have to either cancel them or to get back to the airport to take it.

You will be there at 6:30 to 7:00 am. The tour boat rides would not be open (not until 10 am). Most of the shops may likely still be closed. Not an experience you want to have after spending time (and money) to reach there. I would do Tai O on another day. MTR from the city to Tung Chung is only about 30 minutes. It will take you 15 minutes or so to reach Tung Chung from the airport anyway. You are not really saving much time (especially you need to store your luggage away). I would suggest to take your AE ride, go to your hotel, store your luggage with bell service (since most likely you won't be able to check in until the afternoon that day). The go out and visit other places near the hotel to get started. Plan Lantau for another day. With MTR, it is really not a big deal to go to Tung Chung and Po Lin on Lantau ""island""."

Re: Hong Kong cruise port to airport for 11.10am flight,"From Kai Tak it's maybe an hour on the taxi, from Ocean Terminal 40 mins. So if you're really off the ship at 7:30 there will be no issue being at the airport on time. I have no idea on the current taxi situation at Kai Tak. There were problems at the start, but shortly BC it was usually fine. The problem is the disembarking time: you have to clear immigration and that sometimes causes delays, so I wouldn't rely on that 7:30 time. If it's delayed to say 9 you are in trouble already catching that 11:10 flight."

Simply use the Wan Chai MTR Station, take the MTR Island Line to Sheung Wan Station (the 3rd stop towards Kennedy Town). Follow the signs to use Exit D (Macau Ferry Terminal). That's where the ferries depart to Macau. 2 operators: Turbojet and Cotaijet. Take Turbojet (to sail to Macau (Outer Harbour)) if you are going to Macau old districts and center. Take Cotaijet if you are going to Cotai areas using the Macau Taipa Terminal. Match their ferry schedules.

Because of the holiday, transportation is likely more crowded and local tourist spots are likely extra crowded. Temples will be jam-packed. Many can use the time-off to do some outdoor hikes."

But if the weather is nice and you fancy a day on the water, then look at the Kaito schedules (link posted by HK Ga Yau above) from Ma Liu Shui to the abandoned (and partially restored) Hakka village at Lai Chi Wo (Google for more info). The ferry ride (once a day on Sat Sun and public holidays -- leaves Ma Liu Shui at 9 am and spends 90 minutes going through some of HK's most gorgeous scenery, past the HK Geopark formations, through relatively unspoiled waters to green villages by the sea -- gives you a vision of what the entire New Territories must have been like, 100 years ago. You have to spent 4-5 hours at Lai Chi Wo (bring a picnic lunch) and then the returning ferry departs at 3:30 pm . A less time-consuming alternative which would still be beautiful would be just to take the boat ride from Ma Liu Shui around the Hoi Ha peninsula to Tap Mun (Grass Island). The boat leaves at 8:30 every day of the week. You can then just stay on the boat until it docks at Wong Shek Pier, in the middle of the Sai Kung Country Park, and then get the KMB bus from the Pier to Sai Kung Town. That takes about 2 hours.

Take MTR East Rail to University Station, about 10 mins walk from the pier at Ma Liu Shui Ferry Pier. Best enjoyed on a good day weather-wise and on a weekday outside holiday periods when there'll probably be only a handful of passengers on board until 90 minutes into the journey when the ferry reaches Tap Mun. There's an open section of at the rear of the lower deck where you can get close to the water.

Re: Hong Kong airport to Guangzhou,"I think what's ""best"" depends on your overall journey. i.e. your more precise target destination in Guangzhou. Guangzhou is a big city. If someone asked you the best way to go to Atlanta, you would have asked more precisely in Atlanta they want to go too. The cross-border buses are departing from the airport. But there is a border to cross. It is the border crossing procedure that can get confusing - and you are on your own. The drop off points in Guangzhou are few. The bus drivers just drop you off at whatever drop off point you choose. You then need to figure out how to get from that bus drop off to your hotel or whatever place you want to go (typically by taxi). You should pre-plan which bus route to take and where to get off, with consideration paid to whether it is easy to get a taxi from there. If you have the budget, you can hire some cross-border private car service. AE Express train to Kowloon MTR Station, then take a High Speed Train from West Kowloon Station to Guangzhou is the most comfortable when you are riding the trains. But the end-to-end connections can be a bit of a headache. #1) There is a 12-minute walk from Kowloon MTR Station to West Kowloon Station. See this video (time mark ""0:23"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4n0KyQ3Ldc&ab_channel=MTRHongKong #2) More importantly, High-Speed Rail Stations are far apart. They are designed for high-speed intercity service, not local metro. You have only 2 choices for Guangzhou: A) Gangzhou South Railway Station, which is in Foshan. You would need to make another connection from Guangzhou South Railway Station to Guangzhou via the Guangzhou Metro (see subway map here): https://www.travelchinaguide.com/images/map/guangdong/guangzhou-subway.gif The metro ride will take another hour. (So much for ""high speed"") Or take a taxi. B) Guangzhou North Railway Station, which is further north of Guangzhou near the Baiyun Airport. Again you would need to connect to Guangzhou Metro (backtrack south, doesn't make sense), or a taxi. Which one is closer to where you want to go - again, depends on where you want to go. Highspeed rail doesn't go to the center of Guangzhou. I think it is because the city is old and big, and hard to build the highspeed railway track. Or for other reasons, I don't know. The Through Train serves between Hong Kong (Hung Hum Station) and Guangzhou East, and Guangzhou (""main"") Railway Station. They are closer to the center of Guangzhou. But you would need to take transportation to Hung Hom Station in Hong Kong. (A21 airport bus - from Airport to Hung Hom.) The Airport Express train doesn't go there directly."

However: if you enter HK using your HKID card, you should also leave HK (which you do when going to Macau) with your HKID card. @helen: your situation depends on your nationality status. Do you also have Chinese nationality? Then you will have the three stars on your HKID as well and you will keep your status for life (and you will be able to get a ""home return permit""). If only British nationality, you will lose RoA status if you have not visited Hong Kong in three consecutive years. You don't lose the permanent resident status, but it will be Right to Land - the only differences I know are no more right to vote in local elections, and less favourable conditions when buying property in HK."

Anyway, there's a long and detailed discussion of this subject at: https://www.sm128c.com/hk/ Whether you are regarded as a Chinese national by the HK authorities may be an issue. But for the form, I think what they are asking is whether you have declared a change of nationality previously to HK Immigration. As discussed on the page above: ""HK Chinese citizens holding foreign citizenship may make a ""declaration of change of nationality"" to have their foreign citizenship recognized in China. But by doing so, they will no longer be a Chinese citizen, though they will become be eligible for consular protection in China. Making a change of nationality makes it no longer possible to hold a HKSAR passport, and it may also affect the right of abode status in Hong Kong depending on one's residency history in Hong Kong."" So this is all very complicated. Do you have *** on your HKID card, which is a good (but not perfect) indicator of whether China/HK regards you as a Chinese National?"

But for those of Chinese descent born outside HK to a HK parent pre-1997 things get a bit murky, and I've never seen a clear definition of what happens in all cases. To answer your original question, since HK apparently doesn't regard you as a Chinese citizen anyway, I see no harm in telling them what your citizenship is, but also no value in doing it.

I've read quite a bit about both the Airport Express and the A12 bus - some people think it's missing out to go by the train because of missing the views of the bridges at night - comments welcome - however I'm also looking for speed and convenience regarding tickets for the next day. So my questions are: 1) Is the 1 day Hong Kong Express return valid for 1 day by calendar date or for 24 hrs (which we need)? What is the most suitable ticket for someone arriving and leaving just before midnight on 2 consecutive days? 2) Is there a ticket that combines the Airport Express with all public transport including trams and Star Ferry? 3) We're staying at Harbour Plaza North Point so would change at Central or get the A12 bus directly. What is the time difference between the two including a change with luggage? 4) Could we leave our luggage at the airport and just have hand luggage for the 24 hrs? Also, what are the queues like to go up Victoria Peak on a Sunday? I've read answers to some of these but they are from so many years ago that I wanted to ask again. Thank you so much."

Better views - of the bridges and the city, no need to change, significantly cheaper.

Just pay the fare. The driver will round the change down to the next dollar. The vast majority of taxis are cash only, although some take other payment methods. I guess you could try waiting at the Airport taxi line in the hope that one of those came along. Note though that the views from the upper deck of the A12 are much better than those from a taxi due to roadside barriers etc. Having said that, on the current schedule the last departure of the A12 is at 23:45 (previous is 22:45, which you won't get obviously). So you'd be getting to the hotel around 1am. At that time of night I think I'd just get a taxi all the way. And if I were planning this, I wouldn't be staying in North Point at all unless for some reason you want to be in North Point the next day. I'd get a room at the Regal Airport hotel which you can walk to from arrivals. Get to bed at a reasonable time.

The amount of time you have is enough to go take Ngong Ping 360 Cable Car to the Big Buddha and Po Lin Monastery. As to Elements, it's a relatively high end shopping mall. There isn't anything too interesting there though. If you are interested in museums, the Palace Museum and the M+ Museum are located near Elements/Kowloon station.

I think you need to figure at least 2 hours of overhead getting out/in. So you don't have 8 hours. 6 hours to use at best. But your layover time does not work well for shopping. Hong Kong is a late-rising city. Shops open until late at night, thus most don't open at least until 10 am or even 11 am. You are arriving Hong Kong at 7 am, a good portion of your layover time is gone. You can shop as in ""browse and look"". But if you have things you intend to purchase, you may want to mention what those are as there are all kinds of shopping malls in Hong Kong. Those mentioned that are convenient to reach from the airport may not be what you have in mind. I think the most practical thing to do, and we had made similar suggestions in the past to short-layover many times, is to take the Airport Express train to Hong Kong Station. Have a meal/drink at the rooftop of IFC Mall (connected to Hong Kong Station), or the nearby Central Piers. You have close-up view of the Victoria Harbour. As the shops begin to open, you can browse the IFC Mall, perhaps more as a sight-seeing event. Then comes time, ride the Airport Express train back to the airport. Edited: 1 year ago"

Re: Budget food near mini hotel causeway bay,"岱民 (and there are others similar) is a chain that specializes in takeaway boxed rice with Chinese toppings. For just $30, you get two choices. For $35, you get three. Extra is charged for fish and some other combinations. The value is certainly very good though it's not something I would want to eat on a daily basis. Note that they are not open for breakfast. Tong Kee is a chain that specialize in various steamed buns. It also serves some rice dishes. It's a budget place as well.

As long as the menu is not handwritten, Google Translate will do a great job translating for you (point the camera to the menu and the translated text floats on top). Especially for the first few times, as you figure out how things work, you best avoid busy hours - particularly lunchtime which is roughly 12-2. Breakfast time is normally not that crowded. I've never had issues with staff being rude to me for not speaking Chinese (they love my minimal, broken Cantonese - most gweilos don't know any) but I can imagine that in busy times with customers lining up for a seat they're not all too happy with you taking a long time figuring out what to order or trying to get the message through to the waiter.

Tsim Sha Tsui area has a lot of the city vibe if you just want to see somewhere very busy. Ride the Peak Tram up to the Peak. If you go right before sunset, you can see the city with both day and night views. In between, the area around the pedestrian escalator starting just above Queen's Road Central up to Staunton Street gives you a mix of old and new with a wet market, traditional shops, modern cafes, murals and galleries. Then around Mong Kok, there are markets you can visit. Ladies Market sells mostly touristy cheap stuff so I am not sure whether you will find anything interesting. Just north is Fa Yuen St which is more practical (still cheap). In Yau Ma Tei, there is the Jade Market. Be sure to catch a Star Ferry ride at some point. Where to stay depends on your budget.

Taxi from airport to hotel, drop off bags, by then it's about noon and the city really comes to life. Shops are all open around that time. Star Ferry and The Peak are two of the basics that you should experience, plus some general wandering around just to take in the sights, the smells and the sounds. When it comes to your luggage: you may be able to check your bag right through, keeping just what you need for that one night in your carry-on. If no bags to check in you don't need to be at the airport that early - with check-in luggage about 90 mins before departure, without 45-60 mins is enough. Kowloon to airport is 35-40 mins on the taxi."

Re: Hong Kong Airport Layover,"My opinion: This short layover, and you may have 4 ish hours to use, is too risky to use on visiting the Big Buddha. No matter what mode of transportation (taxi, bus, cable car), it will take at least 1 hour for transportation from airport to there, plus waiting time. If you assume taxi both ways, at the airport you are okay there probably will be blue taxi waiting, but when you are up at Ngong Ping, and there is no blue taxi around - there you have no good alternative to get back to the airport. Which makes it stressful. You may have 30 minutes to 1 hour max spending up there without having to worry about catching your flight. And if you miss your flight, then what? You need to think about the real ""price"" to pay if you miss it to evaluate if you want to take this one. If you are okay with it, no big deal, then go. Taking Airport Express train to Central is safer. Train rarely will be out of service. And even if that happens, you still can take taxi."

With crossing streets and fighting other pedestrians it can be 15 minutes.

Re: Buying prepaid SIM cards for internet,"Hi Fred, While searching for SIM cards in Hong Kong, I was told there is not one card that works in all 3 places and even if there was, it will be super expensive. Instead, I got one prepaid card for HK only, and then a separate card that took care of both Macau and China. I believe it looked like this below (probably cheaper if you buy in HK). https://www.amazon.com/Greater-China-Unlimited-Macau-Taiwan/dp/B08BZ2DV2Z HOWEVER, I had issues with using it. I first visited Macau and had no problem using it there. However after relocating to China, I found that the card did not have service. I tried to connect to the China 5G network as per the instructions but it only showed me 3G options and even those kept disconnecting. I was in Shenzhen, a big city, so I believe 5G should've been available. I'm also not sure if these multi-country cards can only assign one phone number for one country and you're stuck with it? Luckily, my original SIM from the United States is from T-Mobile and my plan includes free international data at 2G speeds so I was able to survive from that. However, if you're planning to use China apps like Baidu Maps on 2G, it will be painfully slow. So my takeaway is that if it might be simpler to just buy 3 separate cards. Or if you can find a place that sells the pricier cards that works in 3 countries, just make sure to ask the seller how it works when you change location. These cards won't be available at convenience stores. Your best bet would be finding the phone company that sells it."

One time I rode in a taxi where the driver was very eager, and very persuasive that I put everything in the trunk (our backpacks, carry-ons, and small items that we usually squeeze in to the passenger cabin - just the two of us riding). And of course a surprise bill at the end. Well... not much money, but no chance to dispute. Wiser next time."

Re: HK Taxi for 4 pax,"There clearly is a returning issue of some taxi drivers trying to take advantage of tourists, particularly late at night, and particularly around LKF and Wanchai, which has been more or less absent for the past 3 years. HappyFeet's example isn't really a scam - it's just the taxi driver taking advantage of the visitor's ignorance of the taxi fare rules. He didn't do anything illegal. The problem is taxis refusing fares, taking roundabout routes and, in extreme cases, refusing to turn on the meter. To be fair we regularly read stories of police activity to catch some of these drivers; the link from SolentTraveller provides numbers of complaints received but is, sadly, silent on the number of prosecutions resulting. Taxi drivers work on the assumption that a visitor here for a few days is not going to want to spend hours doing police paperwork for the sake of maybe HK$300, There are some HK expat residents who really don't help the situation by ""negotiating"" with taxi drivers through the passenger side window before getting in (in the way that one tells the destination to a London cab). This is just wrong. If the taxi has its For Hire light on then just get in and then tell the driver where to go. I often need to get a taxi at around midnight from near the top of LKF. My approach is very simple: flag down a taxi with its light on, get in, and then tell my destination in Cantonese (I don't really speak the language, but a few words marks you as a resident not a tourist as far as the driver is concerned)."

People set up shop several hours beforehand in the prime spots. You can also book restaurants overlooking the harbour, but these are rather expensive and I'm not convinced that fireworks are that great when viewed from indoors.

Of course do check closer to the date whether it goes ahead.

Since the city started reopening last Autumn, we have made a handful of international flights out of HK. Time spent at airline check-in unpredictable and difficult to gauge, could be just a few minutes or 30+ if you find a long queue in front of you with lots of luggage. However, HK immigration and security clearance into the restricted area of the airport remains light years faster than what I've had to endure in European airports for our return flights. 5-10 minutes max to to clear immigration and security and you'll be freely walking around in the restricted air side of the airport.

You would need to clear immigration (Exit Hong Kong) at the Hong Kong Port facility for sure. Then you purchase the bus tickets. Then you board the cross-border shuttle bus to go to Macau riding on the HMZ Bridge. The shuttle bus acts much like a ferry. You have exited Hong Kong at that point. You can make the journey from one ""country"" to another, en-route. You haven't quite gotten there yet. On the other side of the bridge, the shuttle bus will stop at the Macau Port facility's bus terminus. Everybody gets off. Now this is where I am not entirely sure... I don't think you need to clear the immigration/custom on the Macau side. Ask the workers. There should be a door or a way or something that you can enter the ticketing lobby to purchase a bus to ride back to Hong Kong without entering Macau (not going through the Macau immigration). It happens... someone may have gotten an emergency phone call while on the bus and has to change the travel plan to head back to Hong Kong immediately. It can happen to all of us. And there are travelers who have visa or admitability issues with their passport/visa status that they are denied entering Macau. Thus I don't think you need to enter Macau (and then immediately exit Macau). If that is not possible, well you enter Macau and go right back in to the same building to ""ext Macau"" and to ride the bus back to Hong Kong. Just take a little longer.

Re: Experiencing Hong Kong-ZhuHai-Macau Bridge (HZMB) from HK?,"#1 and #3 - Per the question above about having to clear Macau immigration or not before returning to HK. I believe HPFT is thinking about the extra ticket booth and set of self-service ticket machines you find right before you exit (outflow direction) the Macau Port to join the queue for Golden Shuttles bound for Hong Kong. I've also wondered in the past if this somehow created opportunity for arriving passengers from HK to skip Macau immigration, buy tickets here and immediately return to HK. However, when arriving into Macau, you have to use a separate Port building entrance (inflow direction) which leads you directly through to Macau Immigration and as far as I recall, there is no place or option to circle back/join the (outflow direction) which leads out of the Port and to where you will pass the extra ticket counter and self-service machines for the HK bound shuttles mentioned above. It is an interesting thought and something I'll look into with more attention next time I take shuttle over to Macau. However, as far as I can think, I don't believe this is possible."

Re: Experiencing Hong Kong-ZhuHai-Macau Bridge (HZMB) from HK?,"SolentTraveller is also spot on correct about how the single and double deck Golden shuttles works. In short, you get in the queue and are shepherded into the next shuttle that is on deck. There is no choosing on your part. Further, even if you are sent into a queue for a double deck shuttle, it is not ascertained that you will find good seats on board. Usually those lucky to board first, get the top side seats in front. There are good views of the bridge with topside seating, not so great on lower level and single deck buses. The rest of the passengers, quickly file in and take what seat is available and the shuttle bus leaves a few minutes later. Everything is pretty quick. In my honest opinion, it can be nice to see the bridge if (1) you enjoy architecture, engineering, bridges, (2) sky conditions are good and (3) you are fortunate to get a double deck shuttle and top side seat. Personally, I like bridges and enjoyed seeing HZMB for the first few trips after the bridge opened. Now I just take a 40 minute nap on the way over and back. As for sky conditions, it makes a big difference and is something I would give consideration to before making the journey on the day. If you can't see much, it sort of defeats the purpose and is reason to wait and try another day. As for the last factor, Shuttle bus and seat choose is beyond your control. You just don't know if you get single or double deck nor what order you will board. You take what seat you can find, sometimes they are great seats, other times, you are in the back of a single deck bus and can't see much. Anyway, just something to think about it."

But if you are visa free for HK and Macau, you could just enter Macau and go back to departure level immediately and go back to HK. But since there is 6 days in your trip, Macau worth 1 day to travel in my view."

No use to go up to Ngong Ping too early. The bus ride from the Tung Chung bus terminus to Ngong Ping takes about 1 hour. In the afternoon, too late to go to Tai O or Disneyland. You can take the MTR (Hong Kong's metro/subway) to Hong Kong Station. It is really fast. Can jump start your sight-seeing before you return to your hotel to rest. With the convenience of MTR, no need to ""go Lantau Island"" because you are on Lantau Island. Going to the center of the city is really not a big deal. Just a short ~30 minute subway ride."

On the other hand it will give you a rather unique peaceful experience there. As you have plenty of time, a visit to the Wisdom Trail is a nice addition. It's common and convenient to combine Tai O with the Buddha, it's only about 15 mins bus ride between the two. This are the two main sights on Lantau. Especially good for you as you're having an early start. You could be in Tai O around noon which is a great time to arrive there, have lunch in one of the many restaurants there, maybe enjoy a boat ride through the village, explore the place on foot, and mid afternoon head back to your hotel. From Tai O you have options: there's the ferry to Tung Chung (really nice ride but infrequent - weekdays departing at 10, 14, 16, 18 - more departures on weekends/holidays, actually I'm surprised as it used to be far fewer), the bus direct to Tung Chung (frequent and efficient though mostly the same route as the bus you had to Buddha), or bus back to Buddha and the cable car down (also a very nice ride).

Hong Kong Science Museum - Tsim Sha Tsui MTR Station. Ocean Park, you can even walk to Ocean Park's entrance. Cheung Chau Island, go to Central Station and walk to the pier to take the ferry. Now Kowloon Walled City is NOT convenient to get to no matter where you stay. Without learning Hong Kong's many bus route and where to board and where to alight, ride MTR to Sung Wong Toi Station and take a short taxi there. Or you can walk, about 0.5 to 1 mile.

There are shops and restaurants everywhere so you can get to experience a lot more if you so wish. In comparison, Nina south locates in a quiet part of Wong Chuk Hang and there is almost nothing around it except the Ocean Park. While it is not far away from the MTR station, it is still very isolated and there is not much you can do if you stay there.

Re: Recommend a hotel in HK,"Strictly looking at the hotel locations, without knowing the inside conditions or level of service of these hotels etc, I also think that Dorsett Mong Kok may be a better choice if all other factors equal. Nina is located at an industrial stretch (but you can say that about Dorsett), yet from Dorsett you can walk for 10 minutes or so you can be in the heart of the busy corner in Mong Kok, full of shops and eateries. No need for a bus or MTR. Can't say the same for Nina. Your first daily goal is to walk to the Wong Chuk Hang MTR Station. To stay there, in fact, I would recommend finish your dinner somewhere else when you sight-see (maybe the closest nearby Causeway Bay neighborhood) before you go back to your hotel to rest for the evening. To maximize your time utilization. Dorsett is much closer to the airport than Nina.

For the last day, you may consider more in-depth experience that are way less touristy. Sai Kung, Unesco Geopark, Mai Po Nature Reserve and wetland park, Wong tai sin temple, M+ and palace museum, numerous beaches and hiking trails, Stanley, sheung wan, Aberdeen, east soho and Tai On Building, walled villages etc. These are all important and integral aspects of HK that many tourists miss, regrettably. If you venture deep enough, i am sure you can make good use of the last day. Since hong kong is an extremely safe place, you can go absolutely anywhere, even those seemingly underprivileged regions."

Re: Do the hotels in Hong Kong restrict # of persons in a room?,"There are a number of issues in play here. The main issue is the terms for the use of Marriott rewards. Like most reward programs for the largest hotel groups, the contract between Marriott group and the properties requires a standard room and double occupancy for award stays. Anything beyond a standard room and two people in a room is up to the discretion of a particular hotel property. They can allow four people in a room, but they are only required to allow two. (This is rarely an issue in the United States, most hotels here do not care and do not enforce the occupancy limit. But they may charge for additional persons beyond two) Because the reservations are handled automatically by a computer, the properties may set it up to accept only up to two people in a room by default. Another issue is many hotel rooms in Asia and Europe are relatively small, that they can physically accommodate only two people sleeping. It does you no good for them to accept a reservation for four people in a room, but give you a room with two twin beds. Where are the two kids suppose to sleep? Some hotels in Hong Kong do have family rooms, but they will be charged at a higher rate and not considered ""standard rooms"", and therefore not bookable with points."

Have narrowed it down to Harbour Grand Hong Kong or Harbour Grand Kowloon.

Food Options in hotel Rooms best suited to 2 adults and 1 Child Best Views.

There are a very small number of dodgy taxi drivers who hang around places where tourists go and try to scam them, but they are a tiny fraction of the total. The standard rules for taxis anywhere will keep you away from them: always pick your taxi - never let a taxi driver pick you; hailing a moving taxi is better than one that is ""loitering"" unless it is sitting on an official taxi rank; make sure the meter is switched off before you enter and switched on after you enter; in case of any issues make it clear to the driver that you will happily call the police (112 and 999 both work on your mobile, but the driver will recognise it immediately if you show him 999 as the dialled number waiting for you to press call.)"

Re: Question about Octopus card,The Tourist Octopus is a sold product which you buy for HK$39 which is non-refundable. You have to load the card with stored value to be able purchase transport fares or other goods with it. Any unused stored value which has been added to the card can be refunded at any MTR Customer Service Centre before leaving HK and you keep the card which is deactivated; https://www.octopus.com.hk/en/consumer/octopus-cards/products/sold-tourist/index.html The Standard On-Loan Adult Octopus costs HK$150 of which HK$100 is stored value and HK$50 is a deposit. If the card is handed in at any MTR Customer Service Centre any unused stored value is refunded together with the deposit less an admin fee of HK$11. You don't keep the card. https://www.octopus.com.hk/en/consumer/octopus-cards/products/on-loan/standard.html Edited: 1 year ago

It takes a good 2 to 3 hours, one-way, of transportation overhead between Hong Kong and Macau. If you go as you planned, @1000 am take the cable car up Ngong Ping, by the time you reach Macau it is late afternoon or near dark. Many of the places you are thinking of visiting/sight-seeing can be closed or close to closing. Seems to lose the meaning.

Re: Day trip to include Ngong Ping Cable-Car, Buddha and Macao.","Another thing to keep in mind in regard to Macau is that traffic is a mess there and travelling around from one place to another is often very slow and unpredictable compared to what you will experience in HK. As such, you need to budget buffer time for getting around between the Port Passenger Building and downtown and/or the Cotai Strip. The good news is that if you do want to visit both, there is 24 hour a day transportation between HK and Macau. The best news in addition to the slow travel around Macau, most World Heritage attractions and museums close around 6pm so you might find little sightseeing time once you arrive. The major casino properties are open late so if this is what you want. In the end, like HPFT says... Macau is basically like visiting a different country and there is a heck of a lot to see/do there now so a 1/2 day visit is really short.

We would prefer to stay on HK Island as we also have a family wedding and get together mid September. There seems to be a large number of hotels, I'm finding it difficult to decide. Also, since we'll stay for 4 days after the wedding and want to do trekking and other non-touristy sightseeing, maybe there are options other than on HK Island that may be less expensive and just as nice? Lantau Island for instance? Thanks in advance."

Re: Opinion on One-Eight-One Hotel and suggestions,"""One-Eight-One Hotel and Serviced apartments' is a good choice. "" Not familiar with this property but reviews here on TA and Google reviews look ok. Not as close to an MTR Station as I like but its a pretty good area around HKU and Kennedy Town with some decent promenade nearby if you are eager to be near the sea and Victoria Harbour. Another hotel option that I like is called East. They are on the other side of HK Island at Quarry Bay. Rooms are modern, nice and some have great views of the harbour. Importantly, they are right next to the entrance to Tai Koo MTR Station, allowing you to get around the city quickly. I'd give a look see of this property as well. You mention ""good value"" and about other options other than on HK Island that may be less expensive and just as nice? I might also suggest looking into Hyatt Regency at University. It is in a different part of Hong Kong, just outside University MTR Station near ShaTin. They have rooms with excellent views of Tolo Harbour and if trekking is a big interest, it is closer to some of the best hiking and country parks in HK. As this property is further away from HK Island and Kowloon, they usually offer noticeably lower room rates. Lastly, with the extension of the MTR East Rail Line last year, University Station is now connected all the way to Admiralty Station on HK Island - 35 min travel time from hotel door to Admiralty. By comparison 1-8-1 is 20 minutes away from the same location on HK Island. Anyway, just a couple of suggestions to think about. Good luck with your search and hope you find a place you are happy with."

I know there are multiple posts regarding long layovers in Hong Kong but I think the current situation requires a post of its own. I will be travelling with a group of 26 people (including me) from New Zealand to Netherlands via Hong Kong both ways. On our return flight from Netherlands to New Zealand there will be a 15 hour layover in Hong Kong at the beginning of June. I think the first question would be are we allowed to leave the airport at all or would we require visa's to leave the airport? If no, then it makes the rest of the post obsolete. However if we don't need visa's, does anyone have any ideas/suggestions of what me and the group could do during this time? Ideally whatever we did during this 15 hour period would be under $100-150 NZD/per person. Things that I'm trying to keep in mind: - Easy activities that can accommodate our group - Easy access too and from the airport as we don't want anything to delay us catching our flight back to New Zealand - A decent experience of what Hong Kong has to offer - Cool sites to take great group photos at - We do have a few plus size people (not too sure how this might impact some activities) - If I've missed anything out that you think I should be looking into please let me know :) As this is the first time all of us will be going to Hong Kong or even long-haul international travel, I'd love to have a fair idea of what to do in Hong Kong that is relatively easy and smooth to follow. Or if this isn't something that can/should be planned over the internet, would I be better off going to a local travel agent? Looking forward to hearing all the great advice from you all!

Take the Airport Express Train to the HK Station (last station), (HKD$115, same day return fare). Stretch your legs by walking to the Peak Tram terminus (30 min). Take the Peak Tram up to the Peak (HKD $148 return fare). Walk around the Peak, take your iconic HK group photo. Lunch is going to be a problem with that many people. I personally like the Peak Cafe (Peak Lookout?), as it has historical interest for me (was there when I lived in HK, many many years ago.). But it's not cheap. Or you can wait till you get down from the Peak. Try to avoid the office lunch hours (12 to 2). There are many restaurants inside the IFC mall, where the Airport Express Train station is. If your group don't mind fast food, there is a Pret a Manger there. Or your group can break up for lunch. Then after lunch, take the Star Ferry over to Kowloon (another iconic HK photo op). Fare is HKD $5. Maybe have afternoon tea at the Peninsula, another iconic HK activity. I personally prefer another location, as the Peninsula is very touristy. And it'll be difficult witha group of 23. Next, more walking, maybe along the famous Nathan Road (photo op), but don't buy anything there. After an early dinner, back to the airport."

Re: Recommendations for BBQ Pork Pastry,"Traditional Char Siu Bao 义燒包 (bao = bun) is usually served at dim sum in restaurants. Sometimes you can buy them frozen in supermarkets. The dough is steamed and it should be fluffy and white in color. Char Siu Chan Bao义燒餐包 is a variation. Instead of a steamed bun, the dough is baked and hence the name ""chan bao = dinner roll'. So the top can be slightly browned due to an egg wash, or may have a sweet yellowish coating like pineapple buns. Char Siu Sou 义燒酥 is also baked. But instead of a bread dough, it uses a puff pastry so the sou is pastry-flaky. All three types will have bbq pork inside. But you can find Char Siu Chan Bao or Char Siu Sou on bakeries, because you can eat them ""at room temperature'. Traditional Char Siu Bao is usually only served hot at dim sum, because the bao loses the fluffiness when cooled. Edited: 1 year ago"

Come back up through exit (D2 - West Kowloon Station) on the other side of the road. Here you are on an elevated plaza area with no vehicle traffic. Walk west all the way to and through Elements Mall, making your way to the bridge crossing back over W. Austin Road into the Cultural District park. Inside Elements Mall just follow signs pointing to West Kowloon Culture District, past the ICC Sky100 Observation Deck attraction. You will shortly exit Elements Mall on an elevated bridge that puts you right into the park around 1-2 minute walk from the entrance to M+ This route above is a bit laborious and not an easiest to navigate but a heck of a lot shorter and quicker than what Google Maps suggests. You can also take a mini-bus (77M) to avoid the somewhat complicated walking route mentioned above. From Star Ferry, you will need to walk up to the China Ferry Terminal (China Hong Kong City). There is a light green bus pick up directly on Canton Road just in front of the entrance. It drops off along W. Austin Rd. just in front of M+ (next to last stop) after a 5-6 minute ride.

I grew up at Haiphong Road crossing Canton Road in the early 60's. Back then it was not too bad. Life was simple. Until Kowloon Godown decided to sell their warehouse real estate and developers turned that land into the present day Marco Polo hotels, Harbour City, and later on China Hong Kong City. And the old Whitfield Barracks was turned over to HK Government, who later turned the barracks into the present day Kowloon Park.

You can switch (at the same taxi stand, just maybe 40-50 meters away) to take a Red Taxi who is licensed to take you to Tsim Sha Tsui.

We would like to see the city as much as possible on Sunday, and visit Disneyland on Monday. We have 2 options for hotels: 1.Hong Kong Skycity Marriott Hotel- will be comfortable to leave the luggage and easy access to Disneyland (taxi?). At this opportunity we will probably take the airport express train to the city and back on Sunday. However, I don't know how much time will be left, since we need to first take the shuttle to the hotel, and we will have to go and come back from Hong Kong station in the city. 2. Holiday inn Golden Mile - this might be more comfortable for the first day (taxi?), but we will have to go with all our luggage. What do you reccommended for us? Which of these 2 option is better?"

Such as using Marriott points or Holiday Inn points? #2) It sounds like you are booking the hotel for 1 night only - Sunday night - correct? For Monday you won't be needing the room for another night before your flight? Since you planned to go to Disneyland on Monday and nowhere else, staying at Holiday Inn Golden Mile will not help you (actually will create a burden of going back there to retrieve your luggage and then to the Airport again, if you don't use the room for a second night. One suggestion is to stay at Hong Kong's one and only airport hotel: Regal Airport Hotel Hong Kong You can walk there with your luggage. It is connected indoor from the Arrival Hall. About ~1000 ft (300m). There you can drop off your luggage, get your room, walk back to the airport to take transportation. Airport Express Train is convenient, directly from the airport. But if you are going from the Airport to your hotel in the city, AE train may not necessarily be a good option any more since they are not running their connection shuttle. For example: if you are staying at Holiday Inn Golden Mile, I would take the Airport Bus A21 from the airport instead. It is a little slower but a good sight-seeing opportunity. The bus will drop you off at a bus stop within 1000 feet of walking to your hotel, along the street. It is better than needing a transfer."

If you arrive late, consider dropping SoHo. SoHo has a good Sunday vibe during the day but by the evening, it's more like a restaurant/bar area.

After that, take the Star Ferry to Tsim Sha Tsui as Sammy suggested. Sight-see around the promenade. When time comes to return to your Marriott Hotel, 2 options: #1) Simply take a taxi from Tsim Sha Tsui Star Ferry Terminal taxi stand to Kowloon MTR Station to take the AE train back to the Airport. Since the fare from Kowloon Station is lower than from Hong Kong Station, you just use your tickets. No extra procedures involved. Taxi fare for this ride is about HKD $30 to $35 or so for all of you. Or: #2) Ride the Star Ferry from Tsim Sha Tsui back to Central Pier. Walk to Hong Kong MTR Station (5 minutes). Take AE Train from there back to the Airport. You pay for the ferry fare x 4 (HKD $6.5 per adult for upperdeck, Sunday). https://www.starferry.com.hk/en/service Price differences between 2 options are not too big.

Then MTR from Tung Chung to Sunny Bay. Then transfer to the Mickey Mouse Line from Sunny Bay to Disneyland Station. Too cumbersome. You won't save much money with 4 people.

Re: Itinerary with 3 Kids,"Day 1 - Note that Ngong Ping 360 and Big Buddha are near the airport so if you go to TST to check-in to your hotel first, you are going to have to backtrack all the way back out to the western end of Lantau Island to visit these places including Tai O. If you want to visit these places on Day 1, consider going to Tung Chung (10 min from the airport) and leaving your luggage in storage at CityGate Mall. You are right outside the Ngong Ping 360 lower terminus from here and can begin your visit. Then head back to Tung Chung to get your luggage afterwards and make your way onward to TST to check-in to your hotel after that. It will save you two long journeys (45+ min) of travel around HK on the day. Day 3 - Your schedule is light. You can knock out these attractions together in 2-3 hours in the morning and have the rest of your day to do other sightseeing. Day 4 - Also a bit light. But good to think about attractions like the Science Museum which are good for the kids, easily a place you can spend 2-3 hours with the kiddos. We also have a LEGOLAND Discovery Centre at K11 Musea in TST that will be in the area you are visiting on the day. The Aqua Luna junk boat ride is ok for me personally. What I like better is the Star Ferry evening harbour cruise which also timed for the Symphony of Lights laser show https://starferry.hongkong-tickets.com/?gad=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw4NujBhC5ARIsAF4Iv6e4J0MnGwRucQYkqa6vWFqh7875FhCGJ7v7X4JUFiAfAbgTtWrJcmgaAoqiEALw_wcB Day 5 - {Day 5: Lamma Island (is it worth a visit with kids??),} What are you looking for? Lamma is a chilled place with a backpacker(ish) seaside community, some quality km of easy hiking trails and a couple of clean nice beaches. But you can find pretty much all of that elsewhere in HK as well. The beaches around Stanley for example are pretty good as well and you are next to an even neater seaside community and street market. It all depends on what you are looking for."

Also, you want to be flexible and plan a visit when the weather looks cooperative. Meanwhile, Science Museum is closed on Thursdays. I do like Lamma Island.

I thought I had read that Aqua Luna has an open deck, so a bit nicer?} Just a personal preference. The Aqua Luna is a touristy junk boat ride. Nothing wrong with it but just not my cup of tea. The Star Ferry on the other had is a historic, classic, charming vessel that is a more authentic ride experience. It is a quintessential part of HK, something that everyone should do when visiting the city for the first time. If you don't want to do their 1 hour harbour cruise, you can take the short 8 minute ride across the harbour between TST and Central at anytime. {And would it be better to ride the ding ding after the peak excursion or do this on a separate day? I assume riding during the day will be less crowded than in the evenings?} I love the ding ding as well and enjoy riding it often. It is nearly as charming an experience as the Star Ferry. You will definitely have some free time on your hands if you do the Peak, HK Park, Zoo & Botanical Gardens in the morning. It is convenient to pick up and ride either direction from nearby Queensway if you do the HK Park last. Unfortunately, it is impossible to predict if one tram will be full up or have lots of seating/standing availability, especially at stops in the Central/Admiralty area where you will be sightseeing on the day. Just get on the platform and watch them as they approach. If one is full up, let it pass and wait for the next one or two. You shouldn't have to wait long for one that has some seats or standing room. Alternatively, just get on a busy tram and as those seated upstairs disembark, which happens regularly, make your way and have a seat. Alas, this also somewhat depends on how long you want to ride the Ding Ding. Believe it or not, taking a near full ride is a great way to see Hong Kong at a slow leisurely pace, you pass through a handful of uniquely different districts and see some amasing streetscapes and scenes. I personally love going through Sai Ying Pun/Sheung Wan area, seeing the endless Chinese medicine and dried seafood shops along Des Voeux Road. That is really neat, especially from the upstairs seats. To do this you can take MTR out to Kennedy Town and board in that area, riding east. Trams are not usually crowded in the K-Town area. Then just right east for as long as you want to go all the way to the end at Shau Kei Wan if you like. Alternatively, take the MTR to Shau Kei Wan and walk over the the Tram station, board and ride west toward K-Town."

Is it necessary to get a 5 day visa or is there a daily pass? Answers (1) Answered by Andrew | Jun. 01, 2023 23:52 reply Yes, you do need to obtain a 5-day visa on arrival and you are eligible for the 5-day VOA. However, it is not possible to get by train. The only way is to take a ferry from HK to Shenzhen Shekou or Luohu or Huanggang Ports. Shekou is more recommended as you may wait for a shorter time.

Left our hotel in Mongkok at 7.30, cab to Mongkok east, from where we took the train to Lo Wu. Got to the visa office before opening at 9. We were numbers 9 and 10. A very slow process . Firstly handed over our passports and paperwork and then paid the visa fee. Contrary to what I read online beforehand,, this can be paid with a card. Next another long wait whilst visas processed. Around 10.30, we were called up to the counter to collect and them proceeded through customs, another long painful wait. We got through around 11.15. A mother and daughter from our hotel, who we assisted , were numbers 11 and 12 and were not called for another hour, so it must be done in batches. We went straight to the commercial centre and started looking around. We made a rookie error by allowing a young boy to lead him to his shop. Couldn't get rid of him for hours, thus bypassing the first couple of floors. I found the prices not really cheap. I bargained aggressively and usually ended up with the goods, but it was a slog. Best buys for myself were prescription glasses ( I bought 6 pairs ) and some nice phone covers. The children's wear was disappointing and nice shoes for them practically non existent. In the past I got quality Disney costumes for my grand daughters, but these were nowhere to be seen. Quite a few of the stalls were closed. I would go again, but perhaps stay a night or two in Shenzhen at the start of the trip, flying into HongKong and then travel back to HongKong for the duration of my trip.

Taxi, maybe 30 minutes (but can be longer if you start from Hong Kong Island side). From Macau to reach Disneyland, it will likely be at least 2 hours each way because of border crossing and multiple transportation transfers."

The Pier in my opinion is the best CX lounge, I like the space, and layout and the food variety. The seats and chairs, tables are kept in good condition. I also like the Wing, but the Wing seems more busy and crowded. The layout is more divided. I just used the Deck last night, it is rather smaller compared to the other two, Food selection was less and certainly didn't look as appetizing. Drinks were fine, not bad variety. Armchairs were getting old and lumpy. Noodle Bar area had no plugs for charging devices. I liked the size of the washroom stalls at the Deck. Large enough that when I am travelling alone, I can bring in my carry on bags and luggage inside, so didn't have to worry about security of my bags, when I often have to leave them outside the stalls.

Kowloon is the name of the peninsula between Victoria Harbour and the New Territories and includes a handful of districts. It is where you are staying (TST district) and spending Day 1. Is there somewhere specific that you were thinking for that Kowloon mention? When thinking about Macau as a day trip option think a larger version of Malacca's World Heritage area with Portuguese style buildings in a Chinese city instead of Dutch in a Malaysian setting. It's different and unique but as pointed out, it is going to be very hot in August and a visit requires quite a bit of travel both ways from your hotel in TST. Could be a long and tiring day for a 75 yr old person. Cheung Chau is a place I think about for those who want a day out to enjoy fairly easily hiking/walking over a fair distance (takes a couple of hours but isn't particularly difficult) mixed in with some cultural & heritage attractions, a few beaches and connected by ferries to/from Central and Stanley on HK Island. I like 1/2 day trips to islands like Cheung Chau and Peng Chau but generally prefer the cooler months of the year. Again, might not be ideal with an elderly family member during August when it will be extremely hot and higher rain probability. As possible inclusions, there are some very nice gardens and parks you can think about visiting that won't be terribly far from where you staying at Page 148. Consider places like Nan Lian Garden & Chi Lin Nunnery, Kowloon Walled City Park & Wong Tai Sin Temple.... There are other park/temple combinations in Sha Tin as well."

Walk up the steps if you are up for it or just admire from the bottom of the staircase. Also, take a bus or taxi onward to Tai O and just walk around.

We could get cold but we generally only have a handful of days under 12 Cel throughout the year. Plus, this is the dry season so much less chance for rain at this time of the year. There is no risk of extreme heat in January. Hazy skies can be an issue during winter, I think this is what minxbaby (post 1) was referring to and this affects visibility such as trips to The Peak or to the Big Buddha but there is little you can do to predict if this will happen or not. This is one of the best months of the year for hiking. As long as it is isn't too cold, which is rare, there are long days with pleasant temperatures, allowing full day hikes of 8-9 hours. This also means that it can be great for longer days, spending more time outside at Disneyland, Ocean Park and making a day trip to Macau. The only issue I see with your schedule is trying to visit Ocean Park, Disney and Macau on back-to-back-to-back days which may be very tiring. If you have enough days, perhaps do Macau, next day Ocean Park and then switch your last two days (21st and 22nd) so you can do some lighter and easier things before hitting Disney the next day. Another option is to simply choose between Disney and Ocean Park unless you are a theme park junkie in which case - do them both. Also, I would recommend doing these (Disney, Ocean Park & Macau Day Trip) on weekdays instead of weekends if possible... in order to avoid more intense weekend crowd pressure and make things less tiring. This isn't always possible but if so, its better to visit these crowded attractions on non-weekends. Have fun with your trip planning"

From most places taking a taxi to the airport takes only 30 to 45 minutes depending on location, and is available 24x7. Arriving at Kai Tak Cruise Terminal, taking a taxi to the airport hotel just to drop off the luggage and then go back out to sight-see in the city is disadvantageous because one of the longest distance for a taxi ride in Hong Kong is to reach Hong Kong Airport. Taxi is the best solution. But I would advise you to select a hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui area where it is convenient for everything. Drop your luggage there and head out to sight-see. Next morning you can take your taxi ride (no matter how early, there will be taxi available) from there to the airport, just one time. Instead of ""to airport"", ""back to city from airport"", ""back to airport (hotel) again at night). It will save you time and money. Hong Kong tour guides generally don't provide transportation.

Many are reachable using MTR (Hong Kong's subway/metro) with a short walk. For good reason. Aim to go to the older parts of Hong Kong/Kowloon, which usually also are highly populated and less organized. Kowloon: go to Sham Shui Po. e.g. walk along Fuk Wa Street at about Nam Cheung Street. Here is a look from Google StreetView: https://goo.gl/maps/gaFJjgm9SsVkroVK8 This is one of their street markets. Sham Shui Po is one of the places I lived when I was in elementary school. It has been over half a century. Not much have changed. You can walk from there to Tung Choi Street + Mong Kok Road. This is the venue for ""Ladies Market"". Look at buildings along the street you will see many of those overhead neon signs and business billboards. Along Nathan Road, north to south, many of them. On the other side of Nathan Road - along Shanghai Street. Businesses along Shanghai Street haven't changed that much over the past 60-70 years. Yau Ma Tei and Jordan are a few of those very old-school districts with no much new (real-estate) development. Temple Street - which has been a night street market for over half a century... what most tourists won't notice, along both sides of the street, upstairs are once (and still have some I am sure) red-light industry activities. Over on Hong Kong Island, the oldest districts are Sheung Wan, Sai Ying Pun, and such. Walk along Queen's Road Central and uphill from there (not as much down on the Des Voeux Road (ding ding tram tracks) because Hong Kong real-estate developers churned over the land for newer and taller buildings constantly. If you walk up the hills, along some small streets where it is hard to develop the land for bigger office buildings (or mega-millionaire residence) you will see more of old Hong Kong. Lots of history there. Look up some Hong Kong heritage walking trails that go through old Hong Kong buildings, you can get some info on good self-guided tour paths. These are more than 40 years old. You can be looking at >100 years old."

You have to go through immigration at each end -- four times on a round-trip -- and there's waiting involved and getting to/from the terminals. This is your first time too so it'll be a bit confusing. Doable certainly but it can be exhausting. Note that ferry service is often suspended in Summer when typhoons approach. Summer's also not a great time to be strolling around Macau. Edited: 1 year ago

Re: First time in hong kong,"About the ferry journey over to Macau - Ferries to the Outer Harbour terminal on the Macau Peninsula are now around 70-75 minutes. They have to slow down now and ease into the terminal (no wake) because of major bridge constructions taking place in that area. Also bear in mind that it takes time to get to the ferry terminal and through immigration on both sides. Transportation in Macau is also very slow compared to moving around HK. All in all, you do need to allow 2-2.5 hours travel minimal each way and potentially longer depending on where your hotel is located in HK."

I don't know what Ho Lee Fook makes. They seem to blend Cantonese and Peking/Shanghai/Sichuan styles. For your class of consumption, look for the in-house restaurants in Four Seasons, Grand Hyatt (nearby), Regent Hong Kong, Ritz Carlton, The Peninsula.

From Hung Hom, you can now easily cross the harbor to the Island side or go to many areas in Kowloon and New Territories. But the TST East neighborhood is mostly office. The nightclub business is still around but it pales in comparison vs the glory years. Holiday Inn Golden Miles sits at the most happening part of TST. If you don't mind the hustle and bustle, then it's a good spot. Read some hotel reviews to ensure you know about the rooms they offer. The Mira a few minutes up Nathan Road might be a tad nicer. However, their chic design isn't for everyone. Another choice might be Page 148. It's located on Austin Road so you can still walk to Tsim Sha Tsui. The closest MTR station is actually Jordan. The hotel looks quite decent and gets good reviews. Then if you prefer the bigger brands around Joran, look into Prudential or Nathan. Edited: 1 year ago"

Re: Critique my itinerary - 6 days mid July,"Novotel Century: traditional chain hotel, not as good as the other two on your list. Mira: Designer hotel but the elements might not be for everyone. As Brad said, the location is the best if you want hustle and bustle out the door. Mira Moon: Boutique hotel also with similar design elements but newer. Quieter in the area though you can walk to the happening parts of Causeway Bay and Wan Chai in 5 minutes. Check the hotel reviews and images here on Tripadvisor and see if you like these places. Just between these three, I would choose MIra Moon. Lan Kwai Fong nightlife is quite expensively overpriced. It might be better just to walk the streets a bit. For drinks, go up to SoHo (Staunton St, Elgin St) on a Friday or Saturday. Shopping at Shenzhen is a dying trend due to the rise of Taobao and similar websites. What do you intend to buy there? I wouldn't prioritize a Shenzhen trip for cheap shopping only. On your Wong Tai Sin day, also go to Chi Lin Nunnery. Also as Brad said, group things correctly geographically. Depending on your interest, consider museums like the HK Palace Museum and/or M+ over at Kowloon West. I would also spend some time walking the streets of Sai Ying Pun (seafood street) and Johnston Road (tram tracks). You get more of a local flavor without having to venture far."

Western District feels disorganised if you don't know what to look for but armed with self-walk maps and knowledge of where to go, you can easily spend several hours exploring this district. Here are a link to several heritage trail (self-walk) routes including Central, Sheung Wan and Western District (see link below). These are poorly advertised or promoted but give you a feel for what is available to see in the area. https://www.amo.gov.hk/en/heritage-trails/cw-trails/index.html And for a real bit of fun, do take a ding-ding (HK double-decker street tram) through Western District, especially the area along Des Voeux Road between Sai Ying Pun and Sheung Wan where both sides of the street are lined with Chinese dried seafood shops."

Another famous street market is also close by, which is located at Tung Choi Street and is close to Mong Kok MTR station.

During the validity of PAR, you may use a valid notification slip together with the specific and valid Indian passport linked to the successful PAR to make multiple visits to the HKSAR visa-free. On each visit, you may stay in the HKSAR for up to 14 days, provided that you meet the normal immigration requirements. As for your hotel, I believe that is part of the non-mandatory entries you can fill in during PAR application (see Question 10). The mandatory information are {English name, sex, marital status, date of birth, place of birth, residential address, contact telephone number, India passport number, its place of issue, date of issue and date of expiry}. The line items above that are also found on your passport need to match entirely and perfectly.

Re: need expert advice,"Im not sure about missing out on things because of the rain unless you are talking about hiking (indeed trails can get muddy), ferry rides or long days at theme parks. The bigger problem is the heat and humidity to be honest. The rains are only troublesome when they drop in buckets but these are usually short spells so you just duck under an awning, use covered bridges to walk from one point to another or duck into a mall, shopping centre or coffee shop for a break while the rain is coming down. If the rain is light and potentially ongoing for several hours, just use an umbrella and you'll should be fine moving around the city. HK is designed for rain and hot weather, you'll be surprised how much time you can spend underground, under covered walkways inside bridges or passing through MTR station passageways, keeping out of the rain or heat for the most part. As an extreme example, I can leave my house in the N.T. and get to most places on HK Island or the airport on Lantau Island and not step foot outside until I'm there if I want to avoid rain or summer heat."

Re: need expert advice,"{So the hottest day for you is not a big problem for us but you know, spending lot of money on a good flight, good hotel and attractions tickets and all you get is heavy rain} My point is that heat and humidity is more of a problem than rains. We don't have the same kind of monsoon seasons that India deals with nor the prolonged downpours or flooding that can result from such rains. In my view, unlike other parts of the world, rain shouldn't be a reason to avoid Hong Kong. It just doesn't have that big of an impact here. However, if heat and humidity effect people, this is a real issue during the summer that should be considered. And to be honest, moving the trip to September doesn't really change much. It is still our rainy season so you might end up dealing with a few days with rain. We average 17 days with rain each July and 14 days with rain each Sept so it is not a great hedge. If you really want to avoid rain, you should come during our dry and cooler season - November to March. Temperatures are lower, rainy days drops dramatically (roughly 4-8 days per month) as does the chance for typhoons."

Re: Shenzhen electronic market products in Hong Kong,">>> My brother last year from Shenzhen bought drone for like 20 USD [...] A few things to keep in mind when you buy that stuff. Crap may be a better word. Quality is closely reflected in the price, especially at the bottom end as it gets harder and harder to shave off those last few cents. Warranty generally lasts until the door. Electrical safety. Standards in mainland - if they exist to begin with - are not followed well. Many products that connect to mains power are not safe, and may expose live mains at the low voltage output. Other products may be an outright fire hazard for the use of low quality materials and ignoring safety standards. That said, I've bought tons of stuff off Taobao (while living in HK) and Aliexpress (more recently). There's great stuff to be found at good prices, for me it's mostly electronic components, but also other equipment. Just keep in mind that going for dirt cheap means you're likely buying worthless crap that's often not even worth the rock bottom price. There's a lot of crap on sale on those sites."

Re: Best Area / Location To Stay Hong Kong & Macao,"I don't think HI Golden Mile hotel has rooms with harbour views. Although it is just a few minutes walk to the promenade area. Intercontinental Grand Stanford Hong Kong & Kowloon Shangri-La Hong Kong are both over in TST East. They are just just fine hotels but note the harbour views here are not the famous HK Skyline, its of the island further east. Still nice though. If rooms with a view of the famous part of HK Island are your priority, also consider Marco Polo harbour view rooms. Its right up there with the best of location and best of views. https://www.marcopolohotels.com/en/hotels/hongkong/kowloon/marco_polo_hongkong/rooms_and_suites/index.html and if you want something less expensive, look up the YMCA on Salisbury Rd.

Re: Best Area / Location To Stay Hong Kong & Macao,"Note that the hotels you listed have varying budgets. They probably range from $1,500+ to $4,000+ for a random night. Actually, Regent should be considered the newest hotel. A multi-year renovation project just got finished within the last couple of months. If price is not an issue, Regent would be the top end hotel to stay. Location-wise, Regent is very good, so is Holiday Inn GM, Hyatt Regency and Sheraton. Kowloon Shangri-La and Intercontinental GS are at TST East slightly further away. Their harbor view angle is also less desirable. IGS is the worst located overall though they offer a shuttle service to central TST. If money is not an object, balancing hotel quality and location, I would pick in this order: Regent, Sheraton or Hyatt Regency (pretty much a tie), Kowloon Shangri-La, Holiday Inn Golden Mile, Intercontinental Grand Stanford."

Even though it is probably too early to consider these prices; the approx pricing for the mentioned hotels in May 2024 is as follows: 1. Regent - USD 600 (INR 50k) per night (out of my budget for sure so this is out) 2. Sheraton - USD 300 (INR 25k) per night. 3. Hyatt Regency - USD 300 (INR 25k) per night 4. Holiday Inn - USD 150 (INR 12k) per night 5. Shangri-la - USD 365 (INR 30k) per night 6. Intercontinental - USD 260 (INR 20k) per night The most affordable is the Holiday Inn but I am not sure of its quality. The Kowloon Shangri-la seems to be in a similar line in terms of location to the The Regent with a similar view of the bay. A bit expensive but hoping these prices will drop in due course of time.

Re: Best Area / Location To Stay Hong Kong & Macao,"Mind, you easily pay a 50% premium for a harbour view room vs. the other rooms at the same hotel. If you don't explicitly select ""harbour view"" you won't get it, either. The prices you mention do not sound particularly high to me for harbour view rooms. Whether this price changes or not, and if so in which direction, I really can't predict. That's up to the hotels to decide. I'm actually more surprised you get pricing this far ahead to begin with."

As we said before, Kowloon Shang's view is not as good as Regent and it's very noticeable. I would rate the Shang's view as a B while Regent gets an A+. Regarding location, Regent is within a pretty short walk to Tsim Sha Tsui station and Nathan Road where you see lots of shops and restaurants. Kowloon Shang is a bit further from MTR though the automated walkway in the air conditioned underground tunnel is definitely a good feature. TST East where Shang is located is a bit quieter. >>>The Kowloon Shangri-la seems to be in a similar line in terms of location to the The Regent with a similar view of the bay.

You need to seek for other routes. If you really want to take a ferry directly from HKIA to Macau, you buy the ferry tickets before HK Immigration, and hand over the baggage claim tags (if you have any check-in baggage). The ferry workers will retrieve your check-in baggage from the conveyor belt and forward them to your ferry.

If your flight is delayed and you miss it, you will have to use alternative transportation. I would suggest looking into using the HZM Bridge which is right next to the HKIA airport. There is a regular circular bus (B4 - HK$8.3) between HKIA and HKMB and the ride is just 8 minutes. From there you can buy Golden Shuttle Bus ticket (HK$65). Bus leave every 3-5 minutes during the time you will be there and the ride to Macau is 45 minutes.

The fastest, cheapest option is to just use the HZM Bridge which is right next to HKIA airport. You can do this by taking circular bus route B4 (HK$8.3), the ride is 8 minutes to the HK Port Passenger Clearance building at HZM Bridge. From there you go through HK Immigration, buy Golden Shuttle Bus ticket (HK$65) and get in the queue to board outgoing buses which leave every 3-5 minutes during the majority of the day. The ride is 45 minutes and you are in Macau. It is that simple and straight forward. I would suggest going ahead and purchasing an Octopus Card while at HKIA and do pull out some HK$ from the ATM while you are at the airport. You can the Octopus to pay for the B4 bus as well as the Golden Shuttle Bus tickets across HZM Bridge on both sides. You can also use HK$ while you are in Macau.

Re: Novice Doubts about Trams,"{I heard I need to push bell/button or something to notify driver to stop but to board like can I board from anywhere?} Not to worry. The tram is slow, plodding down the street.... but in a good way. As mentioned above, it stops at every platform along the way and there are many stops so if you did miss one for some reason, just get off on the next. It won't be far up the street. {(2) For distance like sheung Wan to causeway way - is MTR better or tram? what locals prefer and good?} Completely depends on the purpose of traveling this route. If I'm in a hurry, I will use the MTR as it covers this distance in 9 minutes. The Tram takes around 20-25 minutes to cover this distance at street level. Also, during the summer, it can be rather hot and humid outside, trams have open windows to allow air to blow through but there is no A/C so it can be hot, especially on packed trams. The MTR has A/C and kept very cool during the summer. On the flip side, if I have time no my hands and am not in a rush, I will usually take the tram, especially during the cooler months of the year. The ride is nice, allows you to view several interesting districts each with their own unique characteristics. This versus zipping across the island in a tubular underground carriage is just more enjoyable."

With lunch, maybe a couple of hours. The area has some interesting restaurants and cafes, some galleries and what looks like smaller, independent shops. It's pretty easy to keep walking east to SoHo and then the pedestrian escalator area. 3. The tram runs on Des Voeux Road to Queen's Road Central, then Johnston Road to Wan Chai and to Causeway Bay. You can catch it from any stop in between. Tram stops are very frequent, usually within an easy walking distance. 4. There is a tram stop near World Wide House (on your left if going eastbound). Disembark at that stop, walk up Pedder Street to Yat Lok and Yung Kee. Day 3: It's hard to give you suggestions without you listing every major destination you visited previously. I am sure you went to TST and took Star Ferry though?

Re: 3 days in Hong Kong in December - rough itinerary,"From Western Market, I suggest you go eastbound. The tram will take your through Central (financial district), Admiralty, then Johnston Road where you see a mix of old and new. By the time you reach Johnston Road, I think that should be enough for the tram unless you want to end up at Causeway Bay for shopping. Going beyond CWB is not going to yield anything that looks too interesting. A tram moves quite slowly so even if you have time to kill, it's just not worth spending more than 30-45 minutes on it. Note that going westbound from your hotel, Des Voeux West has a lot of dried seafood shops that still has some yeseteryear feel. Staying at Ibis, you can just walk there within minutes. In fact, if you don't mind walking a bit, turn left up the hill at Centre St. There is a pedestrian escalator as well. Between First Street and High Street, there are numerous cafes and restaurants with a good, relaxing feel. There is also a wet market en route which never looks too sanitary. I would still rate it as a local experience though. Going further west (MTR or tram as it's a bit far to walk), Kennedy Town Praya has a nice harbor view that is different from the usually happening view. Within Kennedy Town, there are also numerous cafes, bars and restaurants. It's less crowded overall so it might be a good area to go chill for lunch or one afternoon if you have time."

You can use such a ticket to exit Kowloon Station (lower fare). No problem. The machine will just know your ticket is valued at a higher fare than what you are due. Green light and you are good to go to walk through the turnstile. On the other hand, if you purchase the round-trip tickets for Kowloon Station but you board the AE train at Hong Kong Station, you will be stopped by the turnstile and you need to walk to the Customer Service counter to pay for the fare difference before you can use it.

The problems start after leaving the HK side, as the mainland control points have multiple bottlenecks. The first check is your health code, with a line of computers where you scan but people bunch up and clog up there. Then immigration, and finally the X-ray security check. 45 minutes could be tight during peak hours."

Concessions for senior (meaning age 65+) visitors are currently available on public transport through the use of Elder Octopus cards. The concession is generally that each trip is HK$2. Anyone can buy such cards - the age requirement is policed at the point of usage - anyone using such a card can be asked by MTR/bus/ferry staff to provide evidence of their age; the Octopus readers make a different noise and/or have a flashing light to indicate when such a card is used. Note though that the government has announced that this $2 concession fare will be restricted to people holding a so-called ""JoyYou card"" which is a personalised Octopus card bearing a photo available only to residents. On current plans this change might happen from late 2023 onwards. After the change, under the current system, seniors using an Elder Octopus card would get half fare.

It costs HK$100 of which HK$50 is a deposit, refundable for a small admin fee if the card is returned at any MTR customer service desk before leaving HK. At the current time cardholders benefit from both the transport operators own voluntary concession (usually 50% of full adult fare) and the government subsidised maximum HK$2 fare where by the govt reimburses the operator the difference between HK$2 and 50% of full fare. The concession applies on most MTR, bus, green minibus, local ferry and tram services. However at some time (later this year I think) Elder Octopus Card holders will no longer benefit from the govt HK$2 concession but will still benefit from transport operator concession. The govt HK$2 max fare scheme will become restricted to HK residents only age 60 and over who hold the new JoyYou Card which is currently being rolled out.

After that, the government most likely will terminate the current non-registered senior Ootopus. The date of termination has not been announced yet.

However, HK is ramping up tourist visitor numbers in the post-pandemic era quite a lot each month so not as sure what Sept dip will look like this year.

Wander around Cheung Chau for a couple of hours. Take lunch at some local eatery that takes your fancy at, say, 12:00. Get the 13:15 ferry back to Central Pier 5, arriving at 14:10. Get the 14:30 ferry from Central Pier 4 to Yung Shue Wan, arriving about 15:00.

Ovolo is a boutique hotel. The Southside&East location is not as convenient, but is close to the MTR Station. Again you can take MTR to other places. Ovolo Central is up on a hill if you are okay with walking back to the hotel. It is close to Central MTR Station. If you want to save money, Ovolo is not bad.

But Grand Hyatt askes for a much higher rate because they are right at the HKCEC (Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre), and is geared for traveling professionals and deal makers. Its location actually is not as convenient as Marco Polo. Businesspeople would like to be able to walk 5 minutes back to their rooms to take breaks and make phone calls and not stand in the exhibit hall all day. January is fine. It is one of the coldest months in Hong Kong. But Hong Kong is in the subtropical climate zone. Its ""cold"" is mild. Mean is about 15C, low 12C high 18C kind of days. But occasionally there may be a coldfront hit and the temperature can drastically drop to below 10C overnight. And it will last a couple of days then return to more of the norm. To me that is a great time to visit, as this ""cold"" doesn't bother me. The month of January is very dry. April - high chance being seasonally foggy and drizzle.

You don't necessarily need to take a taxi (capacity 5). Just take Airport Bus A21 and it will take all of you to Tsim Sha Tsui area. These are double-decker buses. Sit on the upperdeck, front rows.

If you don't mind a quick subway trip, head to Cityplaza. Cheung Chau/Sai Kung: September is still typhoon season but you cannot predict when a storm might hit more than a couple of days out. It will still be quite warm (around 30C usually). Between the two, I would choose Cheung Chau unless you want to take the Sai Kung boat to the Geopark. Pigeon: The ""Yau Ma Tei"" Tai Ping Koon location is really at Jordan just to east of Nathan Road very close to the likes of Eaton Hotel. It's decent so give it a try. If you want to Cantonese style fried pigeon, it's served at many Chinese restaurants that also serve dim sum. Monster Building: I don't see why not. The path to these buildings should be accessible to the public. Maybe you can also visit Cityplaza on the same day. SoHo area: Just take the pedestrian escalator up from Queen's Road Central and work you way up. Visit a wet market at the lower section, see some murals, stop at Tai Kwun (old prison) and perhaps join a tour, walk to Man Mo Temple, continue to SoHo for lunch/drinks. Walk west on Staunton St to see a bit of Tai Ping Shan St. Come back and walk down the very steep Aberdeen St for PMQ. When you get all the way back to Queen's Road Central, visit the old Central Market which has been converted to shops, cafes and restaurants."

We will alter the Victoria Peak to weekday but looks like the trip to Cheung Chau should be on Saturday. It's probably crowded too but I assume it's better to visit the island than Peak ?

Re: 6 Days Itinerary Questions,"Though Cheung Chau might be somewhat crowded on weekends, it does have a more happening atmosphere as a result. On weekdays, most islands are very quiet. Times Square/Harbour City: choose one but not both. It's just not necessary. Even if Times Square doesn't have all the brands you need, you will almost certain find that particular shop in Causeway Bay somewhere. Sogo has a lot of brands, too but it's a much less pleasant experience since space is much tighter there. Times Square vs Cityplaza; Tenants are mostly similar though for mid-tier, you might actually find more at Cityplaza. You can always go on their respective websites to see a store list. Restaurants near Jordan: Reunion Garden at Hillwood Road: The dim sum quality is pretty good. It's not the cheapest but doesn't approach a 5* hotel restaurant price either. Chiu Mei Chong at Woosung St: Chiuchow style food. They have various items like goose, squid, tofu, etc soaked in a blend of traditional sauce which is good. They also serve many other traditional Chiuchow items. This place is a small local eatery so nothing fancy. Australia Dairy Company: I don't necessarily recommend going during breakfast or lunch when the line can get crazily long. Their best item is the steamed milk and steamed egg custard. Go in the later afternoon when the line is short. I believe they are now closed on Thursdays."

Re: 6 Days Itinerary Questions,"9:30 departure from your hotel means it'll be close to noon by the time you arrive at say Senado Square. Nicely in time to find a place to have lunch. To catch the 17:00 ferry back to Hong Kong you have to leave from that point no later than about 16:15, arriving at your hotel by 19:00. That schedule leaves you three hours for actual sight-seeing - out of a nearly 10-hour day out. For a day trip to Macau you'd better try to leave earlier than that, and stay into the evening - which is when the city transforms, and the casinos light up. Pretty spectacular and well worth seeing."

Try the Macau forum for this sort of advice and suggestions for your intended day trip to Macau. Also, with such a short day trip stay in Macau, I think it would be best to focus either on the Macau Peninsula to see World Heritage sites OR go all the way to Cotai where the casinos & entertainment properties are and perhaps nearby Taipa. If you do the Cotai/Taipa route, transportation to/from the ferry terminal(s) is much easier as you can use free hotel shuttle services to get there and won't have to worry about figuring our public transportation."

The fares were generally pretty high (by Hong Kong standards at least), as can be expected from such a service, but then you're guaranteed of transport without any fuss. It would totally make sense to me indeed to have shuttle buses running between the cruise terminal and places like the airport, or indeed a major MTR station where if anything there are sufficient taxis available to take the passengers and their (often seriously bulky) luggage to all the different hotels. No need to pay from tax money. It can be payed from berthing fees, i.e. out of the profits the cruise terminal makes. Oh, wait, I think I just noticed a problem with that idea..."

Re: Transfer from Kai Tak cruise terminal,"Honestly I doubt the usefulness of this for cruise passengers. A typical embarking or disembarking cruise passenger has two large suitcases and a carry-on, even the vehicles used on airport routes can't handle this well. A major hurdle here. If that hurdle is overcome (or the passenger is an independent daytripper wanting to see the city - not very common in the typical cruise demographic) they end up at an MTR station which is, from a tourist perspective, pretty much in the middle of nowhere. They still have to find their way from there - dragging their suitcases on the train, probably followed by another train, and a significant walk, to their hotel. That's not something cruise passengers expect to do, they want convenience, and paying a bit extra for that is not an issue. It is of course possible that the cruise demographic has radically changed over the past few years. If so, that'd be a great surprise to me."

Re: Transfer from Kai Tak cruise terminal,">>> passengers travelling a short distance only. That won't happen, as the cruise terminal is a long way from any place any sane person would want to take a taxi to. A ride from the nearest MTR station (Kowloon Bay) to the cruise terminal is about $60. Most passengers will want a longer ride - e.g. to hotels in Kowloon, which would be something like $120-150. That is also key to the whole issue: taxis won't drive that far empty. They basically only drive to the cruise terminal when they have a passenger. There are plenty of fares to be picked up where-ever they happen to be. Likewise the airport, no taxi will go there unless they have a passenger - it's just that at the airport there's a constant and reasonably balanced stream of passengers in and out. Ocean Terminal doesn't seem to have a taxi problem. It is smack in the city centre, making it economical for a taxi to go there to pick up a fare."

You could take the Star Ferry across the harbour and a taxi from there. Considering you are with luggage, I'd suggest first checking out the taxi rank - if there are taxis, use them. The hotel is walking distance from the pier - but this walk involves footbridges and elevated walkways, many only accessible by stairs. Lifts are becoming more prominent but far from all stairs to footbridges also have lifts (or escalators for that matter). Not a good idea with luggage, especially if you're not intimately familiar with the maze of roads and passages in that area. 2.

It was so pleasant to get a taxi within 5 mins. Taxis were waiting for passengers. There was even a worker who helped us load our luggages into the taxi boot. I am not familiar with Hong Kong to give suggestion on what you can see/do till it is time to go to airport. Perhaps other TripAdvisor readers can give you ideas. You have your luggages with you. So do find out if there is a town check-in centre where you can drop off your luggages. Then you can roam Hong Kong for a few hours before going to the airport. Enjoy your trip."

Re: Which hotel to book,"I think you have got quite a bit of research work to do to help understand which of the 14 properties you have listed above is best for you and your family. Here are a few things you can do to drastically cut down on that list. {i don't know where all the metros are situated.} Do you have a travel guide book for Hong Kong with a map of the city? If not, you will probably need to print one and mark a handful of key stations along the Tsuen Wan (Red), East Rail (light blue) and Island (Blue) lines. No need to pen in every single station, just do those in the lower Kowloon Peninsula and between Kennedy Town and North Point (Hong Kong Island) on the Island line. This way you can see where the bulk of the most centrally located MTR Stations are in Kowloon and HK Island. Then use Google Maps to identify the location of the 14 hotels that you have listed to give you a better feel for how close they are to centrally located MTR Stations. When doing this, you will quickly be able to cross off places like Kowloon Harbourview which is a 10-12 minute walk to the Hung Hom MTR Station. This is too far on hot and/or rainy August days. You will also be able to cross off places like Rambler Oasis which is way out in Tsing Yi, very far away from pretty much everything and no where near an MTR Station of use. Then, just look at rating/rankings and reviews for the 14 hotels you mention above so that you can start to trim down your list. Places like Oasis Ave Hotel gets a 3.5 rating on Google Reviews while Royal Plaza comes in at 4.2. Do some comparisons, find out why some of these properties are considered much nicer than others you have listed. Also, it is going to be REALLY hot in August so you may want to give extra consideration to properties with swimming pools for afternoon cool downs for the kids. Some of the places you are considering including Park, Stanford Hillview and Dorsett in Wanchai don't have pools. Anyway, just something to consider. These are some basic research techniques you can use to create a much shorter list of properties that you are thinking about. If you can't pick from amongst those, let us know and forum regulars here can offer thoughts."

Re: Which hotel to book,"Royal Plaza is a popular hotel choice for families and is near the Mongkok East MTR Station. With the East Rail line now extending to Admiralty Station (HK Island), you can move between Kowloon and HK Island quite easily from that location. Very nice outdoor pool and a major reason many seem to choose this hotel. YMCA Salisbury has a good setup and is also very popular choice in TST. The location is right across the street from the promenade and views of Hong Kong Island skyline. Rooms are a bit on the simple, functional side... sort of the same with their pool. Mira is a nicer hotel in TST, better quality rooms. Loads of shopping and eateries around the hotel, Kowloon Park is just across Canton Road and easy access to TST MTR Station. But further away from the harbour and views you'll get from YMCA Salisbury. JW Marriott (5 star hotel) in Admiralty (HK Island). This is a fancy place that I doubt you will ever find comparable room rates to the three places mentioned above. If so, take JW Marriott every day of the week. It is one of the better hotels in HK, can run around US$500 per night per room If you are talking about Courtyard by Marriott. They have two properties in the city. One up in Shatin. It is too far away and not a great option compared to Mira, YMCA Salisbury or Royal Park. The other is a good property and room but no pool if memory serves correct. Its not too far from Sai Ying Pun MTR Station as well. Personally, if I were choosing I'd go with Royal Plaza if you want a large outdoor pool, Mira if you want nicer room and to be a quick walk to the harbour in TST or YMCA Salisbury if you want to be right on the harbour with a decent room and decent indoor pool."

April 4 is also Ching Ming Festival so there are several public holidays bunched up together. It will mean theme parks, shopping malls, restaurants and country parks will be busier than usual that week because of locals having several days off from work and school during that period of time. On the flip side, the weather can be really nice in early April. Very little chance of cold days and too early in the year for extreme heat or typhoons.

Re: Hygiene Surprises in Hong Kong?,"The washing your bowl and chopsticks in lukewarm tea before your meal is a quaint custom that obviously does nothing for the actual cleanliness of said items. It only happens these days in very ""local""/cheap places. Just think of it as a ritual like saying grace, or whatever you do where you come from. All restaurants provide napkins. At low-end very local places these may be in the form of a toilet roll in a dispenser on the table that you can take from as your need. But all medium to high-end places provide napkins just like anywhere else in the world. In my experience public toilets are at least as good on average in HK as in any European country - there was a major step up at the time of SARS (2003) and it has been maintained. The toilets in most higher end shopping malls are pretty good. And finally, please, please do not try to tip restaurant staff in the way that you would in the US. As local places where you pay in cash it is customary to leave any coins that you receive in change on the table. But this will be less than US$2. In places where you pay by card there will often be a 10% service charge added, and you should not add any more unless something really extraordinarily good has happened. Occasionally you will find places which make a point of saying that no service charge has been added. In these cases it is OK to leave nothing (if the service was mediocre) or up to 10% if the service was good. (Only go over 10% if something extraordinarily good happened) Edited: 1 year ago"

Re: Hygiene Surprises in Hong Kong?,"You will probably find Hong Kong quite clean, tidy and well maintained compared to American cities. Some public toilet facilities in Hong Kong are modern and have attendants that keep them clean and tidy. Some even have free showers to use as well. The public toilets out in certain smaller villages may not be in the best shape in the world and those in the country parks can get overused and at times in poor shape especially towards the end of weekends with good weather when hikers flock to the countryside. However, in the main urban districts of the city around HK Island and Kowloon where most spend them time sightseeing, the public toilet facilities, as HK Gau Yau pointed out, are usually just fine and in better condition than what you find in European cities. Note that we have malls everywhere in city as well. They have bathrooms on numerous floors so you can always pop in and use them as well. Note: Interestingly, many MTR stations don't have public toilets. Again, they are usually near malls so you can just go there if the need arises. To add to HK Gau Yau's note on tipping. You can use wave pay features like Apple Pay (iPhone) to make payment at probably 90%+ of restaurants, bars and coffee shops in Hong Kong. If you do this, they never ask if you want to add tip like what you experience in the States. You wave, they offer you a receipt and you're done. When using the MTR, remember to stand to the right and walk to the left while using the escalators. Take business card of your hotel when going out. This way if you need a taxi and worry about communication barriers, just show them the hotel business card and off you go!"

Unless you run into bad luck while here, there is a very high probability that you will be just fine in Hong Kong. If helpful, my wife is a physician and we take hygiene rather seriously. We don't eat in dingy back alley eateries but do dine throughout the city several times a week. We also eat salad that I prepare at home from produce picked up at local markets and supermarkets multiple times each week. Yes, we wash everything before preparing to ensure that it is clean, just like we do when we travel anywhere in the world when preparing our own food. We also eat fruit purchased in local markets and supermarkets nearly daily, every week, again washed at home before consuming simply because it is the smart thing to do. Have been eating locally in HK this way for nearly two decades and according to latest physical check ups and blood workups, we both remain disease free. Chris, you will be here for 5 days and if things go the way it does for the millions of other visitors that enter, stay, eat and use the toilets each month, you too can have a safe and healthy trip to Hong Kong. Just be smart, don't swap spit with strangers or eat foods that you feel unsure about and you will walk away without typhoid, hep B, cooties or whatever else is rattling your confidence. These are general rules of thumb for travel pretty much anywhere in the world and you should follow them while you are here in Hong Kong as well. If you do so, you should be just fine. Further, you won't have to seek refuge in McD or Pizza Hut for disease free hygiene and eating while here either. If you are not confident enough to ascertain and pick out places on your own, there are reputable eateries throughout the city that forum regulars here can recommend to you. Since you seem to have interest in salad, you will be happy to know that we have specialty restaurants which prepare salad, sandwiches, soups and wraps and the likes that have very high standards. I can recommend a few that I frequent in centrally located areas. TreeHouse (Central, HK Island) and Knead (Sheung Wan, HK Island) are very good places to start. Salfee (TST) is another pretty good option. You can also have packaged/prepared salads or custom salad bowls freshly prepared for you at our international supermarket chains like CitySuper or Marketplace by Jason's which have branches scattered around the city. Personally, I don't eat much fruit sold in restaurants in Hong Kong. Not because I'm worried about hygiene but feel less confident in freshness, prefering to pick out my own in markets instead. Feel free to purchase imported OZ/NZ/EU or NA fruit from CitySuper or Marketplace mentioned above. Local supermarket chains Park-N-Shop or Wellcome are ok as well. Hope this is helpful in alleviating your concerns and that you and your wife have a safe, healthy and happy visit to Hong Kong."

Also, hepatitis vaccinations take 6 months, and typical tourists don't plan 7 months in advance (one extra month for the time to get appointments). I contacted clinics and hospitals around here, and none of them routinely give shots specifically for travelers. Generally, they had no idea what I was talking about. Immunoglobulin is not available here. It has to be ordered. To get travel shots here, you would have to have a primary physician who is willing to let you tell him what you need. Tripadvisor is a much better source of information than local doctors, because it's full of people who have been through this. This is obvious. As it turns out, my wife has had all the vaccinations already."

Re: Hygiene Surprises in Hong Kong?,"In case anyone else out there plans a trip to Hong Kong and then gets sandbagged by a bunch of weird alleged dangers right before getting on the plane, I will relay my experiences. We found Hong Kong to be a clean, modern city, just as someone in an earlier post said. As far as I know, neither of us got hepatitis. We didn't spend time rubbing ourselves against the locals, and we didn't borrow their toothbrushes, so I guess we didn't get much exposure. I don't have typhoid. I didn't get any diseases from the water, which is apparently treated by highly competent local authorities. I was told people might be rude, but we didn't have that experience anywhere. Just about everyone was friendly and helpful. Of course, I was raised in Miami, the rudest city on Earth, so maybe the people in Hong Kong were rude, and I just didn't notice. We were not arrested or waterboarded. I think those risks apply mainly to foreigners of Chinese descent, who go to Hong Kong to fight with the government. While we were there, we learned that the locals are terrified of the CCP, which is probably going to do a complete takeover before long and ruin everything, as it has ruined everything on the mainland. The subways and buses were clean and in good shape, much unlike their stinking, dangerous equivalents in New York City. The city appears to be free of violent street criminals, so that also distinguishes it from New York. Two sleazy guys did try to sell us dope, however. The food was good nearly everywhere. Much better than Singapore, which has an undeserved reputation as the food capital of the East. The roasted goose was particularly outstanding. We got lucky and met Mr. Ki, the roasted goose king. Very funny guy. It seems to me that Hong Kong is a place where you can get truly impressive food at just about every price level. You don't really need to go to expensive restaurants to get food you will remember all your life. There was one terrible food experience: high tea at the Peninsula Hotel. We knew we were going to a tourist trap, but we did it just for the experience. The food was garbage, pretty much, except for the scones, which were somewhat better than garbage. I would describe the meal as Barbie food. Two people could stuff themselves at a top steakhouse in the States for what we paid. At least our lunch photos looked good. The weather was unbelievably humid, and everywhere we walked, water from air conditioners dripped on our heads. It seemed like all of the buildings had a good coating of mildew. The buildings are very close together, so there isn't much hope of catching a breeze. We stayed at the Jervois, and there was nothing to complain about except the unavailability of the on-site laundry machines. The staff kept them running all the time, so they were not very useful to us. The suite we stayed in was very clean and quiet, and the people who worked at the hotel provided exemplary service. The neighborhood--Sheung Wan--was a good choice. It wasn't nearly as crowded as other areas of town, and there were plenty of stores and places to eat. Shopping was good in that absolutely anything we wanted was available, but the prices were about like they are in the US, so there wasn't much point in buying things. The selection of electronics was incredible. All in all, a very pleasant place to visit."

These are usually for particular holiday periods or for specific methods of payment like using mPay app. What they mean by separate queue is that there is a queue for purchasing tickets at the Ngong Ping 360 Cable Car terminus and a second queue for those who already have tickets. If you purchase online and advance, you don't need to get into the ticket purchase queue. You skip that line and go to the queue for those entering the platform area where the cable cars are located."

Route #21 only runs once per hour on weekdays (generally at :20 from Ngong Ping). https://www.nlb.com.hk/route/routemap/19 Note also that Tai O tends to wind down from mid-afternoon. The Tai O to Tung Chung ferry has more sailings on Saturday and Sunday. Olympic to Sunny Bay is only 25 minutes on the MTR. Two whole days for Ocean Park is quite a lot. On day 8, Olympic to Hong Kong station then through IFC mall to the ferry piers. Don't walk underground from then HK Station to Central station then to the piers - that's a very roundabout route. Also, although the fast ferry to Cheung Chau is 40 minutes, if the weather is nice I personally would take the ordinary ferry in deluxe class and sit on the open deck at the rear to take in the views. This takes about 55 minutes. Day 9. There's some backtracking here - I would walk from HK Island Station to the ding-ding tram on Des Voeux Road Central and take it west to the Central Street stop (assuming you're after dried seafood shops). Walk generally back the way you came via said shops (if this is in summer then follow your nose to find them!) then pick up the tram at Sutherland Street and take it to Wan Chai (Fleming Road stop) for Kam's Roast Goose. I'm not sure Starstreet Precinct is worth a stop, but if you have time then OK. 4:30pm checkout would require a special arrangement and maybe charge from the hotel. You might have to check-out in the morning and leave your bags with the concierge. Alternatively, if you are flying with Cathay Pacific you could do an in-town check-in at Hong Kong Airport express station as you start your day. Edited: 1 year ago"

You are missing some of the typical destinations like the Peak via Peak Tram, TST Promenade, Star Ferry, etc. Near your hotel at New Kowloon Plaza, perhaps try this restaurant instead of Federal Palace: https://www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/r-royal-ming-garden-restaurant-tai-kok-tsui-hong-kong-style-dim-sum-r683520 I have not eaten there, and Openrice isn't necessarily the most accurate when it comes to reviews, but it looks fine in general. After your dim sum breakfast, proceed to Tung Chung. HK Museum of History is currently being renovated so there isn't much to see. Also, even when it's not being renovated, the two museums together won't take you more than 2-3 hours. You can spend the afternoon roaming the TST promenade and maybe take the Star Ferry across. Assuming you have most of the afternoon, this can be a good day to bus up to the Peak and then take the Peak Tram back down. If you have visited the Peak before, then perhaps walk to the pedestrian escalator area. You will be able to visit the restored Central Market, Tai Kwun and SoHo area."

Breakfast at Central Market. Take Ding Ding Tram at Gilman Street to Des Voeux Road West for dried goods shopping. Take Ding Ding Tram at Western Street to Fleming Road to buy lunch at Kam's Roast Goose. How bad would be the queue be at Kam's Roast Goose on a weekday, maybe Tuesday?

I will be coming in December - will the History Museum be finished renovating by then?

If you are not planning on seeking a meal there, I'm not sure there is much to see specifically at that location that will be of much interest. However, if you are wanting to spend time exploring Wan Chai, I might suggest doing the self-walk Wan Chai Heritage Trail* instead (see link) which includes some very interesting old buildings, some having been repurposed as art incubators and exhibition space. Others just view from the outside and move along. https://www.ura.org.hk/f/project/308/eng_final.pdf Just note that location #10 on the trail which is interestingly in Starstreet Precinct is the site of an old heritage building that was demolished and replaced with a new residential tower and ground floor Italian restaurant. #6 on the map is the southern end of Lee Tung Street so you can easily taken in the Lee Tung Avenue there as part of this self-walk through Wanchai."

We're planning to do a 3 day stopover in Hong Kong. We've never been there before so we're asking for suggestion about where to stay and what to do. We'd be most interested in natural and historic sights. We prefer 4 star hotels in a walk-able area of shops and restaurants.

It's a lot more moving around than the ferry, but is significantly cheaper.

However, if you just want to spend time on the Cotai Strip to see the huge casino properties and entertainment complexes, you can do well to take the Cotai Water Jet from the HK Macau ferry terminal in Sheung Wan.

That four hours is a bit much, it's more like 2 1/2-3 hours to make the one way trip - that's the time it takes from leaving your hotel to arriving at the interesting parts of Macau. An hour for the ferry (or the bus across the bridge), plus overhead: transport to/from piers/bridgeheads, immigration, ticketing, waiting. By the way, those hydrofoils did just fine for me.

Quite a few restaurants will have dual language menus or at least one English menu on hand. Cooked food centres like the one on Lockhart Road don't really bother as they just don't see many foreigners. So it is a real challenge to try to dine at these places if you can't read/speak Cantonese. However, a few around the city have small eateries that make a better effort and do attract some foreigners/tourists who want to try. Here is a list of better cooked food centre options for tourists around the city. The Shueng Wan Market and Queen's Road Market are the closest to Wanchai that are reasonably easy enough to try. https://www.timeout.com/hong-kong/restaurants/best-cooked-food-markets-in-hong-kong Sort of a cross over is the dai pai dong scene or at least the extent of which this famous street food scene remains in Hong Kong.

Re: Two days in Hong Kong,"Star Ferry & Peak Questions Star Ferry TST to Central route begins at 6.30am in the morning. https://www.starferry.com.hk/en/service You can walk to the Peak Tram Lower Terminus. It is around 1.5km (20-25 min walk) from the Central Ferry Pier where you will arrive on the Star Ferry. Use google maps which plots good walking routes you can take. It is a generally flat walk until you reach Garden Road then the last you walk uphill for 300 metres or so until you reach the Peak Tram Lower Terminus. The Peak website states operating hours are now 7.30am. Used to be 7am if memory serves correct but right now it says 7.30am. https://www.thepeak.com.hk/en/getting-to-the-peak/location No need to purchase a ticket first thing in the morning even if visiting on weekend. If you have an Octopus Card, just walk to the till, tap it and enter the platform area, just like when using the MTR. {Is it worth going to/helpful to use the escalators?} What escalators are you referring to? The Mid-Level escalators? These are on the other side of Central District and not something easily combined with visits to The Peak. {Is there anything else I should see before taking the ferry back?} Really depends on your interests and time available. There is quite a bit to do/see/eat in the Admiralty/Central/Sheung Wan area of the city and a great flat hike around The Peak along Lugard Road. It is called the Peak Circle Walk (see link) I consider this the very best, family-friendly, easy hike in Hong Kong. To the west in particular there are several open viewpoints that have outstanding landscape views of the harbour and Kowloon in the distance and the towering skyscrapers of HK Island just below. When sky conditions are good, the scenery is incredible. https://en.tripadvisor.com.hk/Attraction_Review-g294217-d17450219-Reviews-Peak_Circle_Walk-Hong_Kong.html As mentioned as well, plenty of things to do down below The Peak including outdoor recreation (HK Park, Zoological & Botanical Gardens), Museums and art galleries, historic sites and heritage buildings, Central Waterfront, harbour promenades, some good breakfast options, plenty of coffee shops....

You can travel over to Lantau Island from Central but doing so really depends on how much time you want to spend around The Peak and HK Island districts as well as how much time you want to invest doing the Ngong Ping / Big Buddha experience. Personally, during the hot months of the year, I would do this first thing in the morning which won't be possible if you are first visiting the Peak on the day. As such, I would personally do this on a different day but yes it is possible to combine and do both on the same day. If you have finished your visit at The Peak, you can return to the Central Ferry Piers from which you arrived on the Star Ferry. Go to Pier 6 and take the ferry from Central to Mui Wo (Lantau Island) https://www.sunferry.com.hk/en/route-and-fare/timetable?route=central-to-mui-wo From Mui Wo, you can take public bus #3M to Tung Chung Town Centre https://www.nlb.com.hk/route/detail/7 From the Tung Chung bus terminus, you are just a few minutes walk to the Ngong Ping Lower Terminus Station. Unfortunately, arriving here later in the day you will likely encounter queues at the ticketing booth as well as waiting to board cable car. This is why I prefer to come here first thing in the morning when they open at 10am to avoid the queues and get an early start on the journey up to the Ngong Ping Village. The ride is 25 minutes. {I love gardens, so thought of Nan Lian, maybe better to do this in the afternoon and save Lantau Island for my second day?} This is a very good alternative and one I would personally choose to do. Nan Lian and the adjacent Chi Lin Nunnery are easily one of HK's most beautiful combined locations and it is never busy so making your way there after spending time at Central works just fine. You might also want to checkout the nearby Wong Tai Sin Temple if you enjoy temple/monastery visits or the Kowloon Walled City Park which combines a nice garden laid out around old heritage attractions. It is a neat, peaceful garden/park with very interesting historic sites to see during your visit."

The resources below provide an overview of dim sum here in the city as well as some suggestions for how to pick a place and what you might want to try during your dim sum experiences in HK. ------------------------------------------------------ 1) What is Dim Sum? The Basics (Asia Society) https://asiasociety.org/reference/what-dim-sum-beginners-guide-south-chinas-traditional-brunch-meal A really good summary of the origins and history of dim sum along with ordering, dining etiquette as well as popular dim sum choices that are worth trying. How to Enjoy Dim Sum (HKTB) https://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/explore/dining/dim-sum-culture.html Discover HK offers more on the topic with an expected lean toward the local scene with a few recommended places and dishes to sample during visits to the city. ------------------------------------------------------ 2) Why do Dim Sum in Hong Kong? The short answer, Dim Sum didn't originate in Hong Kong but it certainly made its mark on world cuisine here. Generally speaking, Hong Kong is the undisputed Dim Sum capital of the world. If you are going to try it anywhere, do dim sum in HK. ---------------------------------------------------- 3) Where to try Dim Sum in Hong Kong? The good news is that finding good dim sum in Hong Kong is like finding leaves in a forest. It is not difficult at all. In fact as long as you stay away from your Western hotel buffet line, you should be able to easily find very dim sum or yum cha (dim sum & tea) restaurants on your very own, A) How to search for dim sum restaurants? If you want to find places on your own, you can start with our local food review website called OpenRice (see link) https://www.openrice.com/zh/hongkong Just type dim sum and the area of the city where you want to find a place in the search box near the top of the Openrice homepage. You can then scan the search results to see if there is a place that interests you. B) What if I want to try more popular, famous and tourist-friendly dim sum specialists? Start with these publications which provide lists of popular places for tourists to try dim sum in Hong Kong Best Dim Sum in Hong Kong (TimeOutHK) https://www.timeout.com/hong-kong/restaurants/hong-kong-best-dim-sum Best Dim Sum & Yum Cha in HK (SassyHK) https://www.sassyhongkong.com/eat-drink-dim-restaurants-dumplings-best-for-every-occassion/ Best Dim Sum in HK (LifestyleAsia) https://www.lifestyleasia.com/hk/dining/best-dim-sum-restaurants-in-hong-kong/ You'll find good options in the published write-ups above however there are others that you might have heard of or read about elsewhere that are likely just fine. I tend think smart to pick places close to your hotel or near to intended sightseeing that you have planned. You won't need to go far out of the way for good dim sum. ---------------------------------------------------- 4) What Dim Sum should I order in HK? The first couple of resources provided above touch on the basic and most popular dim sum baskets and orders. However, the internet if full of other publications on this topic as well.

Sample Dim Sum Menu Card (One Dim Sum) https://www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/p-one-dim-sum-p17000733 ---------------------------------------------------- 5) What If I Just want to do s Dim Sum Food Tour? No problem, there are food tour specialists that offer Dim Sum experiences that you can register for as an individual or groups. You can find dim sum tour providers here in TripAdvisor or through Google during normal times. Note: Since the pandemic ended and the city has reopened, food tour specialists have been a bit slow to restart their tours. So definitely contact the providers directly through their websites or other social media to find out if they are still open for business and offering their tours again if this is of interest. One outfit that had become fairly popular before the pandemic that I has already restarted their food tours is Humid with a Chance for Fishballs (see link to company and dim sum tour) Humid with a Chance for Fishballs https://humidwithachanceoffishballs.com/hong-kong-tours/food-tours/#DIMSUM-LUNCH ---------------------------------------------------- *This should be enough to get you started on your dim sum research. If you have other questions, feel free read up on the many past questions posted over the years. You can find them using the Search Box at the top of this forum. If you still can't find what you are looking for, just post the question and someone will answer it for you. ----------------------------------------------------"

But I see people doing it every time we have to check-in for late night departures. If these seats are filled up in this departure level in front of the check-in rows, there is also some space to the far left in the downstairs Arrival Hall, near and entrance to the Regal Hotel footbridge and beside a tall LED screen that is often showing some sort of garden / rainforest scene. As soon as you exit customs and baggage collection into the Arrival Hall, you can make a hard left, walk to the far end. You can't miss the big screen mentioned above. You can look for some open seating in that area as well. Not particularly comfortable for long hours of sitting but at least they may be available if the mentioned rows of seats in the Departure Level are all filled up.

Near Ned's you can also try Ashley Road Trading Co. and Kowloon Taproom which are both pretty good. On the other side of Canton Road, there is a slew of bars/restaurants along Knutsford Terrace. These have a bit more local vibe and due to higher concentration of places, you might be able to find cheaper happy hour deals.

The Kowloon Station is for Airport Express line and Tung Chung line which can get you to Central rather quickly but not TST area or other popular places in Kowloon. You can see TST from the hotels and it looks close but requires a near 30 minute walk, past construction and through convoluted routes because of the construction. If you plan to use taxis this isn't really an issue but overall, the two hotels are not great for those who want to make use of public transportation to get around the city. JW Marriott on the other hand is directly connected to Admiralty Station which is a major hub and MTR interchange with access to numerous MTR lines that can get you pretty much anywhere in the city relatively quickly.

Hong Kong taxis are so plentiful. Literally, with the click of your fingers you can hail one. (Okay... relax, just an exaggerated figure of speech, no need to rebut me on that.)

It is not entirely inconvenient. With The Fullerton, it is a new, nice hotel facing the Pacific Ocean. Many hotels in Hong Kong have views of Victoria Harbour. Very few hotels have views of islands in the open ocean. The Fullerton, and I think Le Meridien at Cyberport. I think that's it.

I think the only way to get current, useful information on the existence of any useful promotions will be to call or visit the relevant gyms."

Of course, it is always wise to be aware of the weather. Whether or not the summer months are too hot for hiking depends on the individual's body situation, which we cannot know.

All very fine to mention and point out...... But we do have beginner level hiking & trail opportunities for the most inexperienced of hikers/walkers and even those with families, some of which can very much be done on the whim and by completed by pretty much anyone. As a couple of examples of this point - I've encountered tourists with a 2 and 4 yr old little ones at the top of Tai Mo Shan. It is fairly easy road trail to follow to the peak, hence why you always see families there, not just long distance hikers taking in the MacLehose Trail. And how many families and tourists do we see walking along the Peak Circle Loop Trail every single day of the year? https://www.alltrails.com/trail/hong-kong/central-and-western/victoria-peak-loop#:~:text=Head%20out%20on%20this%202.2,encounter%20other%20people%20while%20exploring. I offer these two examples not to challenge your warnings about hiking in Hong kong 'on the whim' but to instead offer the perspective that you actually can look into our trails and country parks and find opportunities that suit your experience level and interest, even if you rarely hike and/or are in the city for short stays. If being in the countryside and/or hiking is something tourists have interest, there is probably a trail somewhere that will fit their situation just fine."

It's also outright ridiculous to even suggest that a hike in Hong Kong is at all comparable to doing the Mount Everest - even if you're looking at rather tough ones like the Hunchbacks. Of course there are snakes in Hong Kong, there are even venomous ones, however snake bites are extremely rare - and those that get bitten are far more likely to be gardeners or farmers (especially the latter we have very few of in Hong Kong), than one of the many many hikers. Likewise wild boar are by and large harmless - if treated with respect, which starts with keeping your distance. In my opinion the nastiest (by far!) wildlife in Hong Kong are the hornets. I've encountered them a few times, one time they targeted me as well, and in all cases the result was at least one seriously sick person - and no, they were not allergic or so. Just had a few too many stings. Oh, and the monkeys of course. Cute as they are, they're ruthless thieves and robbers."

Depending on the bus company and their routes, typically that's a hotel in Guangzhou. Border crossing and boarding the Mainland bus can be confusing. Take the ferry. You arrive early enough for their earliest departure (only 3 departures a day) to Pazhou, Guangzhou. It is convenient and comfortable. You don't enter Hong Kong Immigration. You go directly to the ferry via SkyPier (the workers will retrieve your check-in bags and forward them to the ferry). You only do Immigration Custom once (instead of twice) at Guangzhou.

The ferry ticket counter is in the Arrival Concourse to the right side of the Hong Kong Immigration.

403,1,14495600,118489572,,,,,,helena,1 year ago,69,Peak tram or big buddha,Morning I am just finalising a layover trip. We will arrive in Hong Kong and have booked Skycity Regal hotel. Landing at 2.30 pm. Plan to go to hotel then either big Buddha or Peak tram then ferry and symphony of lights. I would like to know whether it is better to go to big Buddha or peak tram? I would like to go to whichever suits my itinerary better by public transport and is the easier journey please? After symphony of light we will grab some food. We like street food/ markets. Where is best for this please and easily accessible from Avenue of Stars where we will watch the light show? Any other suggestions you have? We will then go to the hotel ready for a flight out the next morning. Thank you.

Re: Peak tram or big buddha,"Regal is Regal: ""Regal Airport Hotel Hong Kong"". Skycity is ""Hong Kong SkyCity Marriott Hotel"", a Marriott, not Regal. Make sure you know which is the one you have booked. Regal, you can walk to it from the airport terminal. Maybe 5 minutes. Skycity you need to take their hotel shuttle. Do you need to claim your check-in bags at Hong Kong Airport? If not that is better. Do you plan to drop off your carry-ons and backpacks at your hotel first before you go for your afternoon/night sight-seeing? If you do, it will take extra time. If needed to take a shuttle to Marriott that will take a longer time. Time is a bit tight for Big Buddha. Landing at 2:30 pm, you need at least 30 minutes to deplane and go through Immigration Check. If you need to claim your check-in bags, that will be another 20 minutes or so. You need to take transportation (bus or taxi) to Tung Chung first. That's another 30 minutes. At the earliest you may be at the Cable Car Station at 3:30 pm. With (if) picking up check-in bags, or need to drop off carry-ons at the hotel, it will likely take another hour. (4:30 pm). The Buddha Statue closes at 5:30 pm, and cable car closes at 6:00 pm. The ride up (or down) takes ~30 minutes. You will just barely have enough time to tour the Big Buddha if you can be at Tung Chung Cable Car Station at 3:30 pm. Time-wise, Peak Tram, The Peak (with a viewing platform on the roof (fee admission)), will be easier. Forget about your idea of ""street food"". It has mostly gone on extinction in Hong Kong, not like cities in Mainland China or Southeast Asian countries. People can still buy/eat on the street. They need to buy those freshly cooked snack-like hot food from some tiny store-fronts, not from a hawker pushing a 4-wheel mobile food cart like we had in the 60's to 80's. Avenue of the Star in at the prime $$$$$ real-estate in Tsim Sha Tsui by the harbour front. Not easy to find those hot-food shops. One place that is closest to Avenue of the Star you can try is: Between East Ocean Centre and New Mandarin Plaza Block A and B. I am showing it on a Google Map here (Centered): Link: https://goo.gl/maps/6ZedLNtSgYSSpD9L9 From Avenue of the Star, about a 10 to 15-minute walk, the path on a map here: Link: https://goo.gl/maps/51Uf9siQYKAQRL7N8 This is a Streetview picture of what it looks like on the ground. The picture was taken early in the morning. Doesn't look like much because most of the shops are not opened yet. Pan around and ""walk"" around, you will see many tiny stores. You can buy those street-eats from these shops. They are mostly ""packaged to go"" (skewered, paperbag, plastic boxes, styrofoam containers, etc) for you to eat on the street. Some shops don't even have their own dining room. It is a pedestrian-only walkpath connected to a plaza (you may be able to find some benches. Around lunch time, or late afternoon and evening dinner time this area will be populated with pedestrians.

Re: Peak tram or big buddha,"If you go to the Peak, there are some tips: #) Get some HKD cash for your layover. Credit Cards are not accepted for taxi or most transportation and small-amount transactions (such as buying street food). There are ATM machines dispensing HKD notes right at the Luggage Claim area, if you have an ATM card that you can use in Hong Kong. #) Airport Express Train offers the Same Day Return Ticket package for the same price as single-journey. Basically the return journey is free. Buy that package to take the Airport Express Train from the Airport to Hong Kong Station is the quickest way to get there. #) Outside Hong Kong Station is Central Pier. There is also a bus terminus. You can take bus 15C for a short ride to the Lower Peak Tram Terminus to take the Peak Tram. Or else you can walk there, a little uphill, in about 20 to 30 minutes. #) From Central Pier #7, you can take the Star Ferry to cross the harbour to Tsim Sha Tsui. Avenue of the Stars is only a short walk from the Tsim Sha Tsui Star Ferry Pier. And the street food area is about a 10-15 minute walk from Avenue of the Stars. There are elevated pedestrian walkpaths to cross Salisbury Road. #) To return to the Airport, take the Star Ferry once again back to Central Pier #7 and walk back to the Hong Kong Station to take the Airport Express train. Or else you can hail a taxi to take you to Kowloon Station to take the Airport Express train. You AE return ticket (good for Hong Kong Station) is also good for Kowloon Station because it is a lower-cost ride from Kowloon Station. No need to buy a different ticket. But taxi fare will be about HKD $40 I think from Tsim Sha Tsui to Kowloon Station, compared to just ~ HKD $5 taking the Star Ferry."

You can take the Airport Express train to Hong Kong Station, and walk around the harbour-front promenade from Central Piers all the way to the Hong Kong Cenvention and Exhibition Centre, including the Golden Bauhinia Square. It is quite a bit to see, with backdrop of Victoria Harbour. Same way back. (AE offers the Same Day Return Ticket package for the same price as single-journey. Basically the return journey is free.) Or... pick one of the Airport Bus routes: A21 (Kowloon), or A11, A12 (Hong Kong Island). Ride to the end as a sight-seeing bus (Double Decker, very comfortable). Ride back to the airport.

Very little is open in HK before 9-10am but there are some things you can try thqt might be different than what you have experienced in past visits. Another consideration to HPFT's suggestions above - West Kowloon Cultural District which you can walk to from Kowloon Station (20 minute ride on Airport Express) has really grown up during the pandemic. M+ and HK Palace Museums are both very impressive museums that have opened in the past couple of years. Unfortunately, they don't open until 10am each day so wouldn't have time for much of a visit before needing to turn around and return back to the airport. However, you can still walk into the main ground floor lobby of M+ and walk around to see the interior architecture of the building once they open the doors at 10am. You can also walk around Art Park and enjoy the promenade at any hour of the morning. Walk over and have a look at the Palace Museum exterior architecture which is impressive can be done at any hour as well. https://www.westkowloon.hk/en/ HPFT also mentioned Tung Chung for dim sum. To add to that suggestion, there are actually some interesting historic attractions scattered around Tung Chung that might be interesting to find given your layover situation. They are found on this informal Relics of Tung Chung self-walking tour (see link) https://www.amo.gov.hk/filemanager/amo/common/form/TungChungpanels.pdf There are a couple of temples as well as an old lime kiln and Qing Dynasty battery, the last two which you can see at any hour of the morning. Most interesting of the lot is the restored Tung Chung Fort. The information centre inside opens at 10am (Wed-Mon) but I think you can actually enter the fort earlier, have a look at the wall, cannons and walk around the fort on top of the restored wall. Worth a visit to the info centre as well to help understand what you are looking at while there. https://www.amo.gov.hk/en/historic-buildings/monuments/outlying-islands/monuments_07/index.html"

Last experience was this past April, flew with United to SFO similar to what you are doing, arrived at the airport just over 2 hours prior to our scheduled departure. Check-in was slower than usual, around 30 minutes. We then cleared immigration and security in around 10 minutes and had plenty of time to walk over to the departure gate, have a coffee while we waited. Which cruise terminal are you arriving at? If Ocean Terminal in TST, you should have plenty of time to make it to the airport with time to spare. If Kai Tak Cruise Terminal (KTCT), transportation services there is iffy with many reporting very long waits for taxi. The ride to the airport from here is 40-45 minutes as well. You would be hard pressed to make it to HKIA by 8am if you wanted to check in that early. I would definitely recommend downloading Uber app on your mobile phone so that you can arrange an UberX or taxi (can do both through the Uber ap) and allow you to avoid waiting around for free taxi to become available at KTCT."

Area around the airport is pretty sterile. There are some locally - oriented restaurants in the CityGate shopping mall, not too far (by bus) from the airport terminal. But by far the best way to do this type of stopover is to take the Airport Express train from the airport to Hong Kong station, which is right in the middle of ""downtown"" HK. There you can walk around, see some sights, eat, drink and generally have a good time. A same-day round-trip ticket on the train costs $115 HK dollars. Credit card can be used to purchase ticket.

Very doable if you can start off early. 2) MTR to Tung Chung; drop your luggage at the left luggage facility of the cable car; cable car to Ngong Ping; visit monastery; bus to Tai O; enjoy the village; and then either bus to Tung Chung or bus back to Ngong Ping and cable car down. Collect bags, head out to the airport, check in etc. A bit faster solution. Unless things changed I'm not aware of a priority line for the cable car. Booking tickets in advance online does tend to make it a bit faster as you can skip (most of) the ticketing line."

Re: Possible to do Lantau island in half day,"Given that is will be quite hot and fairly good chance for rain in mid-September, I think it is a lot to ask to coordinate doing Ngong Ping 360 Cable Car/Village as well as Tai O on a travel day where you need to be at the airport around 4pm for flight back home. It is doable but would be a bit too stressful for my comfort, even being fairly familiar with how transportation works on Lantau Island. Tai O is a neat place to visit but I wouldn't consider it worth stressing yourself in order to cram in an additional place to see before flying out of HK. To be honest, I'd give it a pass and add to your bucket list for next trip to Hong Kong. There are other things you can do near Tung Chung if you end up with some extra time on your hands. Definitely there will be time to go up Ngong Ping Village. Cable Car starts running at 10am. Luggage storage is available at the Lower Terminus as well as the Tung Chung shopping mall. You can do casual/leisurely visit at the village, see the Big Buddha and monastery. The cable car back down is fun but I enjoy the bus trip back to Tung Chung as well. It is longer but you get to view some nice countryside areas of Lantau. If time is on your side on the day, you can sider doing this as an activity on the day. Have a late lunch at Citygate Outlet Mall back Tung Chung afterwards. Then make your way to the airport when you are ready. If you find you've a couple free hours after lunch, there are a few historic attractions around Tung Chung like the Tung Chung Fort that are interesting enough to use 30-45 minutes time. Taxi or public bus from Tung Chung will have you back at the airport in 15 minutes. Good luck with your planning and have a nice trip to Hong Kong."

Using a VPN connected to a UK server increases the likelihood of apps working, besides encrypting your data between your device and the UK server. I had no issues streaming Amazon Prime videos when using Express VPN when in mainland China. Also, do your banking apps require 2 factor authentication to log in, such as a code texted to your smart phone UK number? And if so, you need to confirm you can receive the code when in Hong Kong or turn 2FA off before you travel, or look into getting a hardware authentication device such as a YubiKey.

Thus you connecting to the bank over a VPN may very well be a major red flag for the bank. Actually this is the exact argument NordVPN uses to recommend you using a VPN while you travel - basically hiding from your bank that you're travelling. Whether that's a good idea to begin with I doubt: you can't hide your location when trying to get money from an ATM. So when the bank detects you connect from your home country (faked - using a VPN), and an hour later you attempt to withdraw money from an ATM in Hong Kong, 12 or so hours flight away, don't blame them for instantly blocking your ATM card as if that's not a red flag indicating stolen credentials, I don't know what is!."

A rather basic but decent hotel, at a great location (at the beach) and quite conveniently located for several trips: ferries to Cheung Chau and Peng Chau, bus to Tai O and Ngong Ping (both on Lantau), a decent choice of restaurants in Mui Wo, and many options for hikes or just a walk in the rural surroundings (and see a very different side of Hong Kong)."

And, if getting really off the beaten track, there are some villages in rural areas where residents let unfriendly dogs off-leash after dark.

I am male, but you will find that there are plenty of female solo travellers as well. As mentioned the Solo Travel forum here on Tripadvisor is a good place to ask questions about solo travel. Personally I do not find solo travel scary. In fact I find it exciting, and it is liberating to not have to make compromises with travel companions about what you want to do or see. Occasionally you can feel lonely. But even that is often temporary. One way to get around that could be to join a tour. By that I mean a day tour. That is a quick and easy way to have some company, and for me it also means that once that is over I can go back to doing my own thing, which is just as important to me. I have never tried to look for a travel companion for an entire trip, and to be honest I would not choose a stranger to be a long term travel companion. Lastly I would add that solo travel is not for everyone. But the only way to discover if it is for you is to do it."

But I don't believe they have a pool. Hari hong kong - 5.3% (however, only 418 reviews as on date): I don't think this hotel has a pool either. I have not seen a hotel which has a pool does not feature it in their website. Holiday inn golden mile - 20.3%: No view. The rooftop pool is a bit forgettable. Conrad - 9.8%: This is a high-end hotel. (Or maybe just high-price). It is a notch higher than the other ones that you put together. = = = = = Second, the ""missing something"" views: Hyatt regency TST has 12.2%: Surrounded by older tall buildings. You need to be above certain floors to have a view of Victoria Harbour. Or else you will be seeing the tinted windows of your neighbouring building. Intercontinental stanford -9.9%: their view to Victoria Harbour is from the side, not straight on. Sheraton Hotels and Towers HK -19.7%: They have a very narrow view of the Victoria Harbour (to clear the Regent Hotel which is blocking most of their view, and the Peninsula Hotel which is also blocking their view). = = = = = Third, the ""finalists"" from your criteria: Kerry Hotel has 7.4% Hyatt Centric (tempting price points and great view) has 12.3% Harbour grand hk - 13.5% Renaissance Marriott hk- 11.6% And Kowloon Shangri-La too Have good, unblocked view of the Victoria Harbour. I have stayed at Harbour Grand Kowloon before (the sister property to Harbour Grand Hong Kong) and would not hesitate to take it. Kowloon Shang would probably give you good value. Renaissance is more positioned as a business hotel (it is next to the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre) than a vacationer hotel. Hyatt Centric is fairly new. I have no experience. If the price is good, it may be a gem. Kerry Hotel too perhaps. Too new for me. Last time I passed that way it was just an empty land."

Hyatt Centric is right there near North Point Pier by the Victoria Harbour. If you select a harbourview roomtype, you are almost guaranteed to have a good, unobstructed view of the harbour (except for the lowest few floors perhaps). There is no other building between this hotel and the harbour. Not the same for Hotel East. It is located at Kornhill and is surrounded by the earlier-built residential high-rises. My eyeball-estimate: to have an unblocked view of the harbour you need to be above 20/F at least at this hotel. Have you checked with the hotel? Sometimes hotels advertise for ""harbour side"" but does not necessarily mean unblocked views. Maybe only a few guests can get the good view from the building. Hotel Management knows good view can demand higher rates. They generally will price the rooms/roomtypes proportionally. For both of these properties, the access to MTR (Hong Kong's subway) are about the same. Both, just a short walk. Hyatt Centric - about 1000 feet (~350 meters) to an entrance to North Point MTR Station, which is closer to Causeway Bay (the shopping/eatery area). Hotel East is about 500 feet (~200 meters) from an entrance to Tai Koo MTR Station. But they are 2 stations farther from Causeway Bay. If view is a priority for you, I would take Hyatt Centric which seems to be a safer bet. And you are up-close to the waterfront."

Re: Good boutique hotels to stay,"Definitely nothing wrong with Hyatt Centric but I'm actually a bigger fan of Hong Kong East Hotel in Tai Koo. We've stayed there a couple times including a Xmas holiday, much to do with the modern, boutique and really nice rooms. Note HPFT is right, the harbourview rooms are on the higher floors and facing north. Do ask for these or select when making reservation. If you don't get one, not to worry, the rooftop bar called sugar here is really nice with excellent views. Food isn't bad, drinks are fine. It is a great place to unwind after a day of sightseeing and before heading out to dinner. The entrance is right outside the Kai Koo MTR Station (exit D1), right on the Island line as well so you are pretty well connected for sightseeing around the city. You are also right next to a good shopping mall called Cityplaza. There is a nice modern urban park called Taikoo Park nearby and a surprising number of western restaurants and coffee shops in the area. It is it a good place for a few nights if you want boutique, a bit off the beaten path area but still very well connected for MTR transportation."

Re: Should I rebook or cancel my trip to HK,"{Should we just postpone our trip for next year? } Your choice. Saola is past us now and moving away from HK but the weather folks at the HK Observatory are suggesting the possibility of a lot of rain early next week and there is still another typhoon Haikui that is sort of in our region that could affect weather as well. None of this is life threatening for early next week but it isn't ideal for travel either. If you decide to postpone in favour of visiting during the dry and cool season, that means coming here from November to end of March. From April through October is when we have wet (rainy) months. You can learn all on this thread with resources about Hong Kong weather and climate https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294217-i1496-k14480965-Hong_Kong_Weather_Climate_2023-Hong_Kong.html As for low crowds at Disneyland? Don't visit the Park during public holidays or weekends for starters. There is rarely a time when there are actual low crowds but these are peak days where it is busier and more crowded than usual. If you can go during midweek during the cooler and dryer months of the year, that is what I would do."

Re: Should I rebook or cancel my trip to HK,Weather won't be entirely stable but it doesn't look too bad per the forecast. The effects of typhoon will mainly be over by the time of your arrival. March and April could be a more comfortable time to visit assuming you don't catch the extremely humid days when everything goes foggy. November is a great time with the only downside being the hazy skies.

And Identity 2 had never entered Hong Kong properly (smuggled in?) and now is leaving. You just risk the chance of being invited to the ""back room"" for further questioning."

Re: Enter and exit HK using different passports,"I just did my ""thought experiment"" a little further. With my example in reply #1: Upon you exiting Hong Kong using Identity 2... Hong Kong Immigration would not know what happened to Identity 1 (yet). So it will just be in their database with a possible violation of the terms/conditions for a visa-free-entry. But you, standing in front of an Immigration Officer, as Identity 2... they know this passport holder has not properly entered Hong Kong (no such a record). Maybe it's their machine malfunctioned, maybe the other Immigration workers entered the passport information incorrectly (but these days with digital scanning the chance of that is very low). So the third good possibility is that this individual, YOU who is standing in front of them, some how (they don't know how yet), has entered Hong Kong with an unknown entry date and now wants to exit. I think that very likely they will invite you to the back room and at least discuss about it and try to understand what may have happened. When did you get in, where did you get in, how did you get in, etc... If they are going to let you go, it may delay your plan of getting on your flight. And if during the conversation something slipped and you spilled the beans that you used Identity 1 to enter Hong Kong. Now they have the 2 ID's that they will link together. Maybe they won't legally pursue you. But they will for sure make notes of these kind of cases. Individuals have multiple identities (and then switching while they are travelling) are more likely regarded as No-Good than Good. Smugglers, drug-dealers, spies. I think you will really create a cloud over your eligibility for future visits. If you want to enter Hong Kong without using your real identity, do it right. Get a good fake passport and stick to using the same one for entry and exit. LOL 😁"

Re: Enter and exit HK using different passports,"{This is just an academic question.Assume that I had passports of two different countires. I used one of time to enter HK. When I left, would there be any problems if I used another passport to do the clearance? Just courious.} Short answer is a big 'Yes'. In fact, it simply won't work. Let's say you have a U.S.A. passport and Israel passport. You enter Hong Kong with your U.S.A. passport which is fine and dandy but then try to exit with your Israel passport, which will not show up on the system as having ever entered HK in the first place, it is going to trip the system and be flagged by Immigration. This could be an honest mistake that requires quick straightening out. There are plenty of dual citizens so perhaps an error on your part, simply provide your U.S.A. passport which you used to enter Hong Kong instead of your Israel passport. If immigration officer is nice and believes you just made a mistake, there is probably nothing to worry about and they will process your official exit out of Hong Kong. However, if they believe what you are doing is somehow nefarious or that you were trying to deceive immigration, like what HPFT described, you could be pulled aside and questioned as to why you tried to use a different national passport to exit HK compared to the one used to enter. Not something anyone in their right mind would want to experience for the sake of curiosity. In short, just don't do it! No benefit whatever, definitely some serious risks."

So appreciate your patience and knowledge! We're going to HK and trying to pack light of course. Which is tricky for a few reasons. First - end of October/ beginning of November HK weather may vary. Second - we're traveling for two weeks, so need enough clothes for whole period. Also - we're going to do sightseeing, park walks and evening restaurants meeting people (although not formal, but nice). So - need as many tips on what to pack - weather wise, time frame wise, and occasion/propriety wise. Would greatly appreciate any thoughts and recommendations. We are of 'elegant age' :) so term 'appropriate' is important for clothes and footwear."

That is personal to how one feels and likes to dress based on temperatures and general weather. What I would say is to not worry too much about temperature range or weather differences. We don't have wild variances (cold in the morning, hot in the afternoon) like other places around the world. It can still a bit hot at the end of October during the middle of the day but leaning into November we start to have some of the best weather of the year with comfortable temperatures throughout the day and reduced chances of rain. When you research our local weather and climate resources, you will find that there is very little chance of cold days (we call cold anything under 12 C (53 F) until December. Also the extreme high temps 30C+ (86 F) will have passed by November. Basically you are looking at a temp likely to range between 17 to 27 (63-80 F). It is similar to weather in NYC around mid September. The rainy season will be coming to an end as well. Still ok chance for light rains the first couple weeks of November but not like what we have during the summer months at all. Typhoon season has basically passed as well. While theoretically it can happen, it is very rare by November. November is a big hiking month for us in Hong Kong for these reasons. The weather is pleasant, you can start early and enjoy cool temperatures and it doesn't really get proper hot anymore during the day so we are able to start doing the longer distance trails 6-10 hour hikes across our country parks. This might also help you to think about what sort of clothes you might want to bring at this time of year."

Re: From Royal Pacific Hotel & Tower to Airport,"Taking Airport Express to Kowloon Station and then a taxi to this hotel is a good balance for speed and price.

Though the distance is not too far, about 700m to 800m, if you walk through this during late afternoon early evening, it will feel like a salmon swimming up-river with your luggage.

However, for arriving in HK and travel down to the hotel, if this is the OP's first trip to HK, walking through Kowloon Park to get to the Royal Pacific may not be a great idea. Really depends on how experienced the traveller is and how comfortable they generally are navigating their way around city streets (and parks). Can you imagine them getting stuck in the maze near Nathan Park and with luggage? Aiya! Flight time and travel fatigue can play a big factor as well. For most convenient transport from the airport to the hotel for someone not familiar with TST, I would just stick with taxi all the way to the hotel or take AE to Kowloon Station & taxi over to the hotel from there.

It probably costs around $300. Staying at Royal Pacific with large bags, I don't recommend using the A buses at Nathan Road. Canton Road and Haiphong Road are always crowded. It will feel tortuous to navigate with big bags for that sort of distance. I also don't recommend going through Kowloon Park. There are a few steps to cross the bridge to the park to start.

Harbour Grand View and Kerry are both near Hung Hom, too far away for useful MTR Stations and sightseeing in the TST district for my liking. Millenium and ICON are nearer to the TST promenade & TST East MTR entrances so they aren't bad. ICON is a chic property and I like their rooms. They nice high floor club lounge as well. There outdoor pool is really nice, great views of the harbour as well. You will find public airport bus A21 that has drop off at Granville Road & Chatham Road around 500 metre walk over to Millenium and ICON properties. It is fairly straightforward and easy to navigate using Google Maps. However, if you have sizeable luggage, I might suggest instead taking Airport Express from the airport to Kowloon Station and from there taking a taxi over to the hotel. This would be most convenient way to the hotel if you don't want to take a taxi directly from the airport all the way to the hotel. Unfortunately, public transportation over to Kai Tak Cruise Terminal (KTCT) isn't convenient and requires MTR and/or bus changes. It can be a challenge with luggage as well. Best to just grab a taxi from the hotel. It is around 15 minute ride."

Those shuttles are indeed often arranged by the cruise company, so whether they're available or not depends on the cruise company. If available, great. There are also public buses running from the cruise terminal to get you to other parts in town. Another good option. Buses I believe nowadays accept contactless credit cards for payment, that saves the hassle of getting exact cash to pay (no change given for cash payments). Taxis are generally in seriously short supply at Kai Tak. A long standing (since opening) and as yet unsolved problem. Taxis are cash only in Hong Kong, no credit cards."

We (local HK'ers) make up only a small percentage of their purchases these days. Now that Covid is over, another interesting phenomenon is the resurrection of the various pharmacies catering to mainlanders. During the peak of Covid, most of them went out of business. The few remaining ones barely had any customers. Once the border opened, the pharmacies are opening everywhere again. There are probably 15 new shops within a 5-minute walking radius of my office. For the more legitimate ones, even their product mix changed. During Covid, they sold more day-to-day items catering more to locals. Now, a lot of those products are no longer available.

Re: Hongkong travel between sep 30- oct 6,"Historically Golden Week has been a Peak travel time for Hong Kong. This has particularly been felt in the form of much higher than usual hotel rates, longer queues for crossing the border to mainland and travel to Macau as well as more crowds at Disneyland, Ocean Park, Ngong Ping 360 Cable Car and Big Buddha, The Peak Tram, Star Ferry and handful of other main attractions. How bad will be the crowds be? It is a bit difficult to judge as the city has been on lockdown or dealing with other matters (2019) for several years in a row so this is the first normal 'Golden Week' we've had in 5 years. Could be pent up demand from mainland visitors that will result in serious crowds this year. For sightseeing venues mentioned above during our Peak travel times, the key is to get there early. Mainland Chinese tourists usually come in the form of tour groups. They can only travel as fast as their slowest participate. So, if you get to the Parks before opening time, you can usually go straight in when they open the gates and enjoy yourself nearly crowd free for an hour or so and with not so bad crowds for another couple of hours. This gives you a few hours of good sightseeing conditions before crowds get bad. Try to show up at noon to enter Disney or Ocean Park, you may face a long queue to get in and very crowded conditions once inside. Similarly, show up at the Lower Peak Tram station or Ngong Ping 360 cable car station first thing in the morning, and you won't likely wait in queue at all or just a short minimum wait.

While the Golden Week has been the busiest time people travel in China and some go to Hong Kong. But that was the Golden Week in the ""Golden Days (or Golden Weeks)"". With Covid, a lot of things in China came to a halt. And things are just trying to recover. Right now what's facing that nation is to get a job (again) for the younger generation, and the real rea-estate crisis which had been brewing for some time. People are facing the probable possibility that they will lose most of their savings, having bought their future home on a piece of paper with all their savings but the bubble has burst. That affects their travel and spending habits. At least the degree of ""crowdedness"" would be less than what it has been."

Note that bus routes may be truncated, as places like the Star Ferry Pier bus terminus are often closed for vehicles. So a little more walk. There are tens of thousands of others that want to go home in the middle of the night so there will be plenty of transport available. If your hotel is more than walking distance from where you go watch the fireworks, you best ask the concierge for details on transport arrangements and how to get back to your hotel late at night.

LOL @TSS: #7 ""The charge depends on distance traveled, thus tagging on both entry and exit. I don't see how it would work with a credit card."" I think the programming can support it (using credit card). Restaurants do it all the time. When you have a meal, they ring your credit card with the ""service rendered"" amount (bill total plus tax but before tips) initially. The amount is marked as tentative. Depending on the restaurant, they may buffer it with 20% to 30% as the amount charged. Then you sign the bill, and add the tips. The restaurant will revise it accordingly as the finalized amount before settling with the credit card company. MTR can access a maximum fare initially on your credit card (e.g. treat it as if you are riding to Lo Wu, maximum fare). This amount is tentative. When you exit your MTR ride with your credit card, then the fare amount is finalized and settled with the credit card company. If there is a ""no show"" (no exit record from that credit card for that day), then the maximum fare will be accessed. Of course the actual programming is probably more sophisticated than that, like how to deal with cases where the same rider Enter, but the Exit was not sensed (while he did wave his CC), and then he rides again with the same CC to Enter. Do you deny him? Or close the last one with Max and let him ride the second time? And then, of course, we will have some family who have 6 kids riding together with the parents... How can MTR expect us to have 8 different credit cards to ride, one card per individual??? They are just kids!!! Edited: 1 year ago"

It then seems to suggest that you must then get the card renewed whilst in the mainland. (Good luck doing that if you don't read or speak Chinese!)"

The area around Hari in Wanchai is fine but not interesting to everyone so worth researching the area as well if you want to give consideration to this property. Cordis is a nice property well located above the Mongkok MTR Station. However, to be honest, these days I prefer to take Mongkok in small doses. Crowds are nuts there the majority of the day and late into the evenings. Langham is a charming property with very comfortable rooms. It is pretty close to the TST promenade where you find world famous views of the Hong Kong Skyline. Star Ferry Pier is nearby and loads of shopping malls, a handful of bars, coffee shops and plenty of casual eats. Still can be rather crowded in this area but more manageable and easier to get away compared to Cordis in Mongkok. TST MTR is near although the station is huge so a bit of underground walking to get to the platforms. Good luck with your property search."

479,1,14537905,118863199,"Mumbai, India",Mumbai City,Mumbai,India,Asia,LoloD,1 year ago,363,Trip Done Report - 9 Enjoyable Days in Hong Kong,"We visited for a family wedding (big Indian wedding:)). We certainly were not prepared for the wonderful, interesting and unique city that Hong Kong is. We enjoyed our 9 days stay in this clean, convenient and orderly city with lots to do and such diversity in food and experiences. We stayed at Midlevels at 2 Macdonnell Road - clean, well serviced and comfortable with a small kitchenette. The stay included a very good breakfast. The staff were very courteous as we realised most people in Hong Kong are. In addition, they offer a complementary shuttle to Central MTR which was a boon. From the bay window in our room on the 24th floor we had a gorgeous view of the iconic Hong Kong skyline that was lit up at night, the botanical garden just opposite and the sea, just about visible between the buildings. Hong Kong is a city that is built on slopes and since we usually walk whenever possible, we got in our share of exercise during our stay. Pedestrians are well catered to and interesting staircases connect streets and localities bypassing the streets that wind around. We cut through the botanical gardens regularly, to walk to our destinations (they are beautiful). We were fascinated by the escalator that runs from Central to Midlevels through some very interesting localities. We used the MTR extensively, paying with the Octopus cards that we picked up at the airport. (My husband was entitled to the elders card giving discounted fares for everything). The MTR is easy to use and connects Hong Kong along with the public buses, really well. This, together with the taxis, that are omnipresent, comfortable, spacious and reasonably priced (only cash) took care of our transport needs. We only used Uber when we needed a large vehicle to attend the wedding functions. We also went on the city tram one evening (upper deck), getting on at Kennedy Town and enjoying the city sights until our destination at Wan Chai. A great way to see the city. We wanted to eat at Joy Hing Roasted Meats having read some good reviews. It was a very small place and packed so we took out the roasted goose. However, we didn't enjoy it - way too fatty for us. Star Ferry is another mode of transport to experience - we took it from Victoria Harbour to Central on HK island. Easy to pay for with the Octopus card or by getting tokens for cash payment. At the Victoria Harbour we had dinner at Nha Trang - a Vietnamese restaurant in Ocean Terminal. We had a table by the window and enjoyed the view of the ferries and junks lit up, sailing by. The food was delicious (spring rolls, crab meat in a coconut curry). We even went on the Ferris wheel at the Harbour in Central. One day was kept for Lantau Island, getting there by MTR to Tung Chung station. There we took the Ngong Ping 360 cable car - the Crystal car with the glass bottom. The wait in the queue for tickets wasn't too long and it was a lovely experience across the water, and the forested slopes to the top. We then walked up to the Tian Tan Buddha. Beautiful access and walk up. After a break for drinks we took the bus to Tai O fishing village. Such an interesting place! Super clean especially unexpected for a fishing village, narrow paved streets lined with interesting food stalls. We tried the salted dried squid and pork at one of these. Pretty good! Lunch was at Solo - a quaint restaurant that is located on a decking that overlooks the water. Small tour boats passed by. We walked to the Pier at the Tai O Public Pier, where the Tai O Heritage hotel is located, hoping to get the ferry back. The walk was through the village, which we enjoyed, so we weren't too upset to find out that the ferry didn't leave from there. Enjoyed some cuttlefish at another stall just before we left. Another island we visited was Cheung Chau. We reached it using the Sun Ferry from Central Pier 5. We went on the fast ferry and returned on the standard ferry on the Deluxe deck. Both ways it was very efficient and comfortable. We used our Octopus card to pay. I needed to top up my card for which there was a counter at the entrance. The Island is quaint with some great places to eat. We ate at a place called Ding Ding Restaurant. It had opened just days earlier. In addition, it was airconditioned which was a boon! We were delighted with the ambience and especially the food - the pork khimchi and the ice cold lemon tea was delicious! We did the short trail the 'Mini Great Wall trail'. Only 850 metres - a paved trail with good views of the sea and unique rock formations along the way. Also on the trail, is the Kwun Yam temple. The Kwun Yam beach is pristine with designated swimming areas, clean changing rooms and toilets. However there was a sign up restricting swimming, as life guard services had been suspended. We even managed to get an ATM on the island to replenish our cash that was running low. Another day, we visited Sai Kung town. We took the A1 bus from the Choi Hung MTR station. We walked along the interesting waterfront where a busy floating seafood market supplies the waterfront eateries, ate at Chuen Kee Seafood restaurant - the set menu of 4 sea food items (lobster, crab, shrimp, fish) and a vegetable dish - all really delicious. We then went to the Sai Kung Cafe and Bakery and had the special buttered pineapple bun and tea. Highly recommended! Street Food Central on Hong Kong Island is a bustling area that has multiple food stalls. While we were there, we happened upon a live TV music show being performed. Wonderful happening place. Walking back we found ourselves at Tai Kwun - the restored Central Police station and prison building complex. The next day we took the funicular train to the Victoria Peak. Interesting experience! After strolling through the Peak Galleria we did the trail along the Circle walk and through Lugard Road - some good lookouts and onto the Pok Fu Lam Reservoir. It was a long hot and humid walk to the reservoir, though upto Lugard Road it was tree covered and cool. From there we made our way to the road and took a bus back. Kowloon Walled City is a beautiful garden with parts of the old city beautifully restored - worth experiencing. We reached it from Lok Fu Place MTR station. Dim dim sum Mong Kok is a great place for dim sum. We over ate there trying out quite a few items on the menu. Throughout, the weather was hot and terribly humid. Loose cotton clothes, sunscreen, peak caps, and lots of water kept us going through the day. We were fortunate to have great weather throughout. All transport is clean, orderly, and really easy to use. By using public transport so much, we experienced different areas of the city and managed to get quite a good flavour of the city - not just the gleaming high rise areas. To return home, we took the Airport Express from Hong kong station. We surrendered our Octopus cards using the refund to partly pay for the tickets. It's a really convenient way to reach the airport that takes you upto the departure hall itself."

Still, bringing some of your own food isn't a bad idea. Airplane food, especially on airlines like UA, just isn't something very appetizing. Also, per my experience, most airlines give you the first meal within 90 minutes to 2 hours once the plane takes off. 3 hours are probably too far into the flight. It's not something important normally but it might give you a reference for when to eat before you board. As to the ""first world problem"" comment, I agree that's just non-sense. Most humans probably get hungry no longer than 6 to 8 hours after their previous meal. Also, the ""first world problem"" comment does not add any value to the discussion.

Plan is to arrive at Hong Kong on 26th of December, stay till 1st or 2nd of January and then travel to Macau and stay till 7th of January. We also need to be mindful that given we are 3 adults and 2 children we will either need 2 rooms nearby each other or one big room which makes it tricky to book. Hong Kong is mostly going to be for children. I am tossing between staying at Disney Hotel where it will be easier to access Disney and allows one of the adults to stay with the children at Disney while the other two explore the city OR staying at a 5 star accommodation which sits between Hong Kong city and Disney. The first option, I would imagine, provides better access, and second option allows to stay at a 5 star up market hotel without having to spend as much for accommodation. Given the above, and the fact that I have heard disney in hong kong is not very big, which option is the better option in your opinion? Is there much to do for children of that age in Macau? If so what are they and do they need to be prebooked? are we better off staying in Hong Kong and just catch the ferry to Macau or move to a hotel in Macau instead?

Since you have enough days, staying at Macau for 2-3 days makes sense. Macau is normally not a destination where you needs to spend 5 days though. As to hotel recommendation, what is your budget? It's much better to post a figure than recommending based on star levels. There are quite a few 5* hotels in HK. Their prices vary significantly. Taxis are affordable overall.

That may steer whether you need 2 rooms, or you may be able to do a suite with foldable beds or sofa dub'bing as a bed at night. The rate of a suite is typically less than 2 rooms. You asked about 5-star hotels between Hong Kong Disneyland and Kowloon. Well, in between, there is Ma Wan (a tiny island), Tsing Yi (a bigger island), and a stretch of land which had been developed into a huge container port, many of the earlier-built residential high-rise real-estates, then the older part of the earlier Kowloon's land development. While there are a few hotels here and there, there is no 5-star hotel, let alone top/nice 5-star hotels. Most 5-star hotels (and there are many of them in Hong Kong) are located in the tip of Kowloon adjacent to or very close to Victoria Harbour. I think given your situation, you want to stay at a Disney Hotel for 2 nights, and then the rest of the time in a different 5-star hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui. Instead of picking something ""in the middle"", then play ping-pong commuting to Disneyland or other parts of your interests in Hong Kong / Kowloon for sight-seeing everyday, which doesn't make sense. For Macau, it is a tad too long especially with 2 young kids. I was going to suggest JW Marriott in Macau's Cotai area because they have an awesome pool and a great lazy river (one of the only few hotels - well it is a shared facility in the Galaxy complex - that has it in Macau). But reviewing the dates of your trip, being in late December/January, unfortunately I think their lazy river would be shutdown for the season. At any rate, I would trim down the time in Macau. Tapei is not ""ferry distance"". It is 500 miles away from Hong Kong, an 1-hour flight time."

Re: Hong Kong and Macau Visit Over Christmas with Children,"Thanks guys, Regarding Disney, we have decided we are not going to stay at Disney as they are unnecessarily expensive and looking at their themed rooms, which was one of the main reasons we were considering them, they look outdated. However do we need to purchase tickets for Hong Kong Disney now as it may get overly busy in late December early January? Is there any rides or restaurants we may need to book from now? I ask because for example the 7 dwarfs ride in Disney Florida is usually booked months in advance and so is some of their restaurants. Is there anything else I need to know about Disney in Hong Kong? Regarding hotel in Hong Kong, we have narrowed it down to Kerry Hotel, Cordis, Ritz Carlton and the Olympian for now. We will likely be needing 2 rooms, the other adult that is coming with us is my wife's uncle who may also be helping with our children if me an my wife go out on our own. Budget is roughly between $1000 to $1200 AUD per room per night.

Other than Disney, are there any good attractions in Hong Kong for Children in 4 to 7 years old age bracket? Same with Macau, are there any other good attractions for Children in 4 to 7 years old age bracket? Hotels in Macau, we have already booked Wynn Palace which I believe is also non-refundable.

Re: Hong Kong and Macau Visit Over Christmas with Children,"Hi Nav S On HK Disneyland - yes, book your park tickets and reserve your park visit date as soon as possible. They're introducing a new theme land this November, Frozen, and given that you will be visiting during the holidays, there is a possibility you might run out of slots. A few years ago, they did not require reserving the park visit date so this is something that needs to be kept in mind. I use Klook to buy tickets and then make the reservation directly in HK DL's official website. On HK Hotels - just be mindful that some hotels count children/infants as one occupant regardless of age. If you book a triple room for example, it may limit the occupant number to exactly three - I.E. two adults + 2 kids will not be allowed. So just make sure to familiarize yourself with the hotel policies. With your budget, I would look into two-bedroom suites for your group. On Macau - whether you are planning to do this at the beginning, middle or the end of your trip, just keep in mind that having kids plus luggage in tow might pose some challenges to your travel. The best option is to arrive in HK and depart from Macau or vice versa so you only travel once. If this is not an option, the most practical way is to travel to Macau directly from HKIA (via bus) if you can manage it and if it fits your schedule. Otherwise, you might need to consider leaving some pieces of your luggage at your HK hotel prior to checking in. We'll also be travelling with kids and a senior this year and so far it is likely that we'll just opt for a day trip to avoid the hassle. If your budget allows it - you can also opt to stay one night without checking out of your HK hotel. 1-3 days for me is enough to see the highlights in Macau.

The buses take you to Ngong Ping (Buddha etc.), Tai O, and a few other places. Good views from the bus (you go over a big hill), worthwhile sightseeing if you have the time. The cable car is a wee bit pricey, and it has its own queues. But it probably does have the best views, I'll grant that. (I've never taken it; I'm always on the bus.)"

You can take the Airport Express train from the airport to downtown (Hong Kong Station) in 25 minutes, and then walk around the harborfront and take a ride on the Star Ferry to Kowloon (and back, to get your train to return to the airport). Buy a one-day return ticket and your return train ride is essentially free. Hong Kong immigration checks are usually fast -- from getting off your plane to exiting the customs area count half an hour. On return, you have to wait in a security check line but assuming you have your HKG-BOM boarding passes in hand already, arrival at the airport 90 minutes before flight time should be more than sufficient. Don't delay -- apply online for your PAR entry permission now, so you can be sure of your entry to Hong Kong.

Re: Stopover at Hongkong,"RE: ""a) Where is the Airport express station? Do we have to go out of the terminal?"" The Airport Express Train was designed very well. The train station is integrated into the HKIA terminal structure. From the Arrival Hall when you walk out, you walk straight on and within 2 minutes you will be at the train platform. Follow the signs. You can buy your tickets at the Arrival Hall (Airport Express Customer Service Counter), or you can even just hop on to a train to Hong Kong Station or Kowloon Station (same line), and buy the tickets when you arrive those stations. For your layover, buy the ""Same Day Return"" ticket package for the same price as a single-journey ticket. Basically the return trip (Same Day) is free. = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = RE: ""b) Can I use US dollar for the tickets and restaurants in the city?

I think you can use your credit card to buy the Airport Express train tickets these days. (I am not 100% sure.) Big, established restaurants would usually take credit cards. Small mom-and-pop or hole-in-the-wall outfits probably won't. There are ATM machines at the airport, right there at the luggage carousels. If you can use your ATM card internationally, you can withdraw HKD cash from those machines. I think the minimum is HKD $100 and then the multiple of HKD $100. Get the $100 and no higher. Makes it easier to use for payments. Edited: 1 year ago"

Thus I have no first-hand experience with the HK immigration procedures for other nationals. From what you described, I think that is probably all you need. What's important, I think, is on that PDF document, did it give you some kind of reference number (that is uniquely assigned to you)? Any mentioning of your passport numbers or anything like that? The reference number is the most important. If the printout is lost, and you have taken a picture of that PDF file with the reference number on it with your smart phone and bring that with you, the Immigration Officer can look that up by the reference number, even if you don't have the print out with you. (Or they might be able to look that up by your passport number, I don't know. It is better to have abundance of supporting evidence than not enough. ) RE: my reply #6. I don't think I was very clear on the following paragraph: ""If you can use your ATM card internationally, you can withdraw HKD cash from those machines. I think the minimum is HKD $100 and then the multiple of HKD $100. Get the $100 and no higher. Makes it easier to use for payments."" What I meant was these ATM machines are configured to dispense HKD $100 bills (but they may disperse some higher denominations as well, such as HKD $500 and HKD $1000 bills.). You can withdraw a minimum of HKD $100, or a multiple units of $100 (such as withdrawing $200 total, $300 total, and so on). My advice was on not to opt to take the $500 or $1000 bills for your short stay. Sometimes it may be difficult to ""break"" them if you are buying items that don't cost much. Some merchants may not be willing to take the bigger bills ($500, $1000) fearing of counterfeits. Edited: 1 year ago"

Re: Three hours in Hongkong,"Take the Airport Express train directly from the airport arrival hall to Hong Kong Station. Buy the ""Same Day Return"" ticket package - same price as the single journey to the Hong Kong Station. Basically the return trip is free. The ride to Hong Kong Station is under 30 minutes. Very fast. Once you are at Hong Kong Station, walk outside towards ""Central Pier #7"" (Star Ferry). You can ride the Star Ferry to Kowloon (Tsim Sha Tsui) and back, for a short harbour crossing cruise. (The crossing takes only about 10 minutes). Or you can walk around the Central Promenade with the iconic view of the Victoria Harbour. You can do both - ride the Star Ferry round trip, then walk around the promenade. Have a soda drink or snack or something. That's about all the time you have, and then back to Hong Kong Station to ride the AE train back to the Airport. Very convenient. Edited: 1 year ago"

Re: Itinerary help,"@chewpei: If you are really really really tired that morning, keep the following idea in your backpocket: There is another bus, route #15 (not #15C) that runs from Central Pier to The Peak. Basically it has the same end-points compared to ""Bus #15C plus Peak Tram"" combination. It is one bus ride, from end-to-end. It will take you to The Peak. And you can take the Peak Tram down afterwards (though traveling backwards on the tram because of the steep tracks). Bus 15 starts from Central Pier 5 (2 piers over, a very short distance), but it stops outside of Central Pier 7 (Star Ferry) to pick up passengers before going on to the rest of the route. If you are really really really tired, you can take Bus 15 up to the peak instead of taking the 2-leg journey (15C + Peak Tram). Take a front row seat on the top of the double-decker bus. Enjoy the view along the way - pretty much the same way as your thought of taking the hop-on/hop-off bus. You may likely even take a nap during that journey. That's okay. The seats are comfortable. At the Peak, outside the Peak Tower, if you take the Mount Ausin Road going further uphill (the one and only road that allows automobile traffic), about 700 feet away, there is a small park ""Mount Austin Playground"". It is a community park. You can even sleep lying down! You are in a park! Recharge. But bring something to lie on. And perhaps a jacket.

Go early on weekday mornings of later in the day to avoid lines. Closed Thursdays. The best items there are actually their steamed egg custard and steamed milk custard. Mixian (rice noodles): Tam Jai and Tam Jai Sam Gor are the most popular, generally more highly regarded than Mixian Sense (which is a Cafe de Coral restaurant). For cha chang teng, try Soul Kithcen (四寶食堂).. I am not saying they are the best but I regard them as above average. Note that it's very hard to get people to agree on which cha chann teng's are good due to the wide variety of dishes served and the varying taste buds.

Re: Hotels with best harbor views,"RE: ""best Victoria harbor views."" Kowloon Shangri La <=== THIS one. Take this one. Best harbour view unblocked (presuming you take the view side, of course). For the fireworks, this one will be the best. Hyatt Regency TST - only on higher floors. Something like >25/F or so? Because the lower floors are surrounded by neighboring buildings. Those rooms at higher floors are likely suites, club rooms or something like that - roomtypes that are at higher price than regular rooms. You can ask the hotel. Grand Hyatt - the harbour view room should be good. From the Hong Kong side. Sheraton & Towers - this one is tricky. To have good harbour view, you need to pick rooms that are at the south-west corner. Only a few per floor, and at a higher floor to clear the obstruction from the Space Museum. Or else the view is blocked by The Peninsular, or by Regent. Intercontinental Grand Stanford - the view is not that good. It is to the side of the hotel and not the prime angle. Renaissance Harbor View - this one is similar to Grand Hyatt. Harbour view room should be good. Check the hotel review page on photographs submitted by their customers to get some ideas.

Even though the harbor view itself can be excellent, the minute you look down, you might see a lot of construction vehicles and dirt. YMCA was renovated not too long ago so it might indeed be a good choice. Kowloon Shang: ever since the new K11 Musea/Rosewood complex got built, a lot of the views to Central is blocked. I have no idea how much of the fireworks view can still be seen as a result. For fireworks from a public setting, a view from Tamar Park might be ideal since it's usually much less crowded that TST promenade."

A short taxi ride to bridge the gap is more practical. If you opt to proceed with riding the MTR Island Line: *) I don't think anyone will come up and challenge you about your suitcases. MTR doesn't hire staff to check at every gate in every station to police passengers lugging their belongings. (Maybe unless someone is trucking a ridiculous huge cargo that may catch the eyes of some monitoring the close circuit TV). *) I hope you are not arriving during the evening commuter rush hours. During those hours, the subway cars may be packed. *) Be courteous and don't lay your suitcases where they block other passengers getting through. One way is to move to the tail end of the train (the driver is in the front of the train), and ride in the last car. There will be no passengers walking through between cars. The tail end usually is less crowded than the middle of the train anyway. *) Don't compete with other passengers when you alight at your HKU station taking the escalator up from the train platform to the ticketing lobby. Usually that's where the congestion is. Wait for 2 minutes or so after your train has departed when most of the passengers have already gone up. Take your time to lug your suitcases. *) Use elevators (whenever available instead of escalators) Edited: 1 year ago"

In a few weeks, we (2 people) will be in HK for the first time. We'll be staying at the Royal Plaza Hotel near Mong Kok East. We arrive on a weekday at 3 pm, and we'll have luggage with us. I guess we'll be out of the airport by around 4 pm, so I assume the traffic will be particularly bad by the time we get into the center. As far as I can see, the older topics on this are out of date because the various hotel shuttles are no longer running. So the options now are: A21 bus: but the stop is about 15 mins walk away, which sounds like a hassle with a suitcase through busy streets. Airport Express train to Kowloon station, then a taxi (but how easy is it to figure out taxis when you get to the station?) This is possibly the fastest option. Airport Express and then multiple changes on the metro. This also sounds like a hassle, and there are few things more annoying than tourists and luggage on the metro when people are trying to get home from work. Red taxi from the airport. This is listed as costing around 300 HKD, which is OK for 2 people, but if (when) the traffic is bad, how much will that increase by? If the most we are likely to pay is, say, 400 HKD, then a taxi seems easiest. But if it could end up costing 600 or 700 HKD because of traffic, then maybe not. What's the best option?"

Re: Airport to Royal Plaza Hotel,"Since you have 2 in your party, just take taxi direct. Don't mess with taking Airport Express to Kowloon Station Plus something. 2 tickets would already be HKD $105 x 2 = $210. Plus taxi fare. That's just a wash. Changing to other MTR lines with luggage is a drag. Taking the A21 bus and walk to the hotel is okay. But you are walking among some of the busiest streets in Mong Kok area, plus the confusion of needing to use elevated walkpaths to cross streets. Not easy for a first-time arrival. Unless you want to pinch the pennies, I would take a taxi. Rush hours in Hong Kong doesn't come that early (4 pm). Unless it is crossing a tunnel under the harbour (you are not, you are going to Kowloon). No it wont be HKD 600 to 700, I can assure you. The ""stuck in traffic"" time-charge jumps HKD $1.3 per minute (after a long distance, and it will be coming from the airport). 1 hour stuck in traffic would cost you HKD $78 extra. You won't reach that high. My guess is a 30 minutes delay, max, going to Royal Plaza. Link to Hong Kong Taxi Fare calculator: https://www.td.gov.hk/en/transport_in_hong_kong/public_transport/taxi/taxi_fare_of_hong_kong/index.html P.S. Plus HKD $6 per luggage in the boot.

Re: Best app to use for public transport navigation,"No one single ""app"" is good for Hong Kong transportation (which is quite complicated because of lots of options, and sometimes get peculiarity.) They all have their good features and short-coming. Just for example. The HKeMobility app mentioned above. Try to use the web version of it. Let's say I want to go from ""Holiday Inn Golden Mile"" to ""Disneyland"". Which is typical of what a tourist would like to ask. You type in those 2 strings as From and To. You will get... Sorry! No options are found.Please locate the ""Origin"" or ""Destination"" to places nearer to public transport stops and search again. Or to break up the trip so that the transfer involved is less than two times. Huh??? From what I gathered, it really takes someone who is familiar with places in Hong Kong to use that app. For example, if you just type ""Tsim Sha Tsui"" (the area name) as the From, to Disneyland. You still get the ""No options are found"" error. You need to pin down to a particular MTR Station, a particular bus stop? How can a tourist use this? = = = = = Google Map in general works okay. I like their interface, and the generality (I don't need to know an exact point, but the general neighborhood, Google can ""best guess"" the missing details, and *generally* works well. But the options Google Map presents may not be the best. It is at least getting your somewhere. Google Map also has an un-stated default that you are taking the transportation NOW. Not at a particular time (which you can specify but you need to change that explicitly. Also note that if you are planning your trip from a different country, Google Map uses your computer's time (in your timezone) to map the best available transportation, which in Hong Kong may be the middle of the night, and the public transportation suggestions may be very different than what to use during the day time."

Re: Getting to China from HK,"If your purpose is go to China for a casual sight-seeing visit (vs planning on going to China frequently and regularly from this point forward), I think your time and money (which are related... time = money) are better spent just getting a China visa on your Australian passport to make your trip, and be done. While getting a Home Return Permit may be possible for you, it will take you a lot of time. First you need to make an appointment with CTS (which from the posts in this forum needs to be made months ahead of time). This appointment (an interview, face to face), needs to happen in Hong Kong. Really, the agent needs to see your face to verify you are who you said you are. Not something can be done online or just writing in. You make a special Australia-HongKong trip just for that? If all goes well, the interview itself is simple and will be done in ~15 minutes, if you have all the needed documents and information ready. But after the approval, it will take weeks to process and get your actual, physical Home Return Permit ready. That's where they need your Hong Kong address where they can send you the notification that your permit is ready for pick-up. If you have a close friend or relative living in Hong Kong, you can sign an authorization paper to authorize that person to pick up your Permit(s) for you. Then what? They would need to use a carrier to forward that to you in Australia? Or wait until your Australia-HongKong Trip#2 to pick up from them? Or you stay in Hong Kong for a few WEEKS more racking up hotel bills (I don't know exactly how long, for mine, done a few years ago, took a few weeks, not sure about now), so that you can go to CTS office to pick them up, and then go on to your tour in China?"

For a day I guess you could manage to rack up some $500 for the distance travelled - add a few hours waiting that'd come to maybe $800 or so. That's just over USD 100. A fraction of the cost you metioned above. But then it doesn't really make sense to have the taxi waiting for you, they can't park near where you'll like to be anyway.

Re: Still possible to get Visa On Arrival at Lo Wu?,"Norwegian citizens, along with the citizens of other European countries are those with the best success results in obtaining a Shenzhen visa on arrival. He should not doubt a second about it. However, since Shenzhen VOA is in huge demand, he should arrive at Lo Wu border crossing, if possible, even before the opening of visa office. Visa office opens at 09:00 and its opening hours are until 16:00 or 16:30. It is important to know that it is possible that he will witness the situation where a quota will be formed for a particular day, so this is the reason why he should appear as soon as possible at the border crossing. The price for Norwegian citizens is 275 CNY. Recent experiences point out that the payments are done in cashless form. In the end, when he is over with his visit to Shenzhen, he can return by taking any border crossing and by any mean of transport. He can even take a high speed train directly to Kowloon West station in Hong Kong. Edited: 1 year ago"

It is very easy to do your tour at your own pace. You take MTR (Hong Kong's subway) from wherever you are to Tung Chung MTR Station. Then you walk (5 minutes) to the Ngong Ping Cable Car Tung Chung Station. Take cable car up to Ngong Ping (it is point to point). You are at Ngong Ping. You can see the Big Buddha Statue from afar. (You don't even need to ""try"" finding it) The Po Lin Monastery is at the foot of that small hill. It will be very obvious when you get there. And there are signs everywhere because it is one of Hong Kong's top tourists' spots. Afterwards, you can walk to the Ngong Ping Bus Terminus (just right next to Ngong Ping Village - the mock ancient village that houses many small shops and some eateries). You can take Lantao Bus #21 from Ngong Ping to Tai O - which is a very small fishing village. You alight at the end Bus Terminus. Tour Tai O. Take a short boat tour or something. Walk around. Have a meal if you like. Afterwards, you can have 3 ways to get back to the city: #1) Take Lantao Bus #21 back to Ngong Ping. And then take cable car again, this time downhill. Then from Tung Chung MTR Station take MTR back to the city. #2) Or you can take Lantao Bus #23 directly from Tai O back to Tung Chung MTR Station without going back to Ngong Ping. #3) Or you can take a different route: take Lantao Bus #1 from Tai O to Mui Wo Ferry Pier. There are frequent ferries from there to Central Pier at Central District on Hong Kong Island. The ferry ride is scenic. Different scenery. At Central Pier, you can walk to Hong Kong MTR Station or Central MTR Station (these 2 stations are connected underground too), you can then take MTR to wherever you want to go. Or ride the Star Ferry from Central Pier #7 to Tsim Sha Tsui on the Kowloon side. Another sight-seeing activity. Lots of options. On Lantau Island, you can also opt to take the Blue Taxi instead of taking the Lantao Bus too. Up to you. Transportation in Hong Kong is very convenient.

Or you can also walk from Hong Kong MTR Station, underground to Central MTR Station (they are connected), then use one of their exits and walk to Lower Peak Tram Terminus. The overall walking time is about 20 to 30 minutes depending on how fast you walk. It is not too far, about 1.5 km but the last 0.5 km is lightly uphill. Or you can take the Lantao Bus #1 from Tai O to Mui Wo Ferry Pier, take a ferry from there to Central Pier (#5). You are at the same point as if you take the MTR to Hong Kong Station from Tung Chung.

You can take the Peak Tram down as you go up. But it is going backwards (the slope is too steep to face forward, so all passengers are facing uphill when the tram car is going downhill.

Re: How to get from Ngong Ping 360 to Tai O Village and more?,"@JV: I understand this is your first time to Hong Kong. It may help if you take a look a map online on Hong Kong's geography. May be ask a friend to help if you are not familiar with reading maps. Just the basic overall. You can appreciate more on how to plan itinerary for Hong Kong. You get the idea of doing Ngong Ping + Tai O, and do the Victoria Peak on the same day from somewhere, right? What do they say? Ngong Ping and Tai O are close to each other. Doing them together makes sense. And most tourists do. But those places are on Lantau Island. Historically Lantau is a big island in Hong Kong where one can only take a ferry to reach, plus the local buses. But since the build-out of the new Hong Kong Airport at Chek Lap Kok, bridges have been built, and subway (MTR) has been built to reach Lantau Island. Thus they are land-linked. From Lantau Island to reach the rest of the city in Hong Kong got much faster. However, because historically it is an island by itself, vehicular access to the rest of Lantau Island besides Hong Kong Airport has been quite restrictive. Buses and taxis serving Lantau Island don't go out of Lantau Island. Even if you take a taxi from Tai O to Tung Chung (blue taxi), you would need to alight and switch to a red taxi to go back to other places in Hong Kong. Taxi licensing issues. These all come down to one point: It takes time for the activities at Ngong Ping and Tai O. For a lot of tourists that's a bulk of their touring day. Combining that with Victoria Peak is doable, though a bit rushed. Especially if you want to take the scenic route, using buses (some are 1 departure per hour during weekdays) and ferries. Thus I anticipated you will reach top of Victoria Peak probably around evening time. Back to your questions: = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = RE: ""1.

You ride the bus from Tai O back to Tung Chung, take the MTR (Hong Kong's train/subway) from Tung Chung to Hong Kong MTR Station. Then you either walk, or take a different bus - run by a different company - Bus 15C from Central Pier #5 or #7 to Lower Peak Tram Terminus, then you can ride the Peak Tram up Victoria Peak.

Roughly how much time do you think we'll be spending for an enjoyable time at each location, while reaching Victoria Peak for sunset or around this time for a comfortable journey"" A typical tourist's pace - NOT COUNTING transportation time from one place to another - Ngong Ping (Big Buddha + Po Lin Monastery), about 2 hours. More if other things interest you. Tai O: about 2 hours. If you take the boat ride, plus walk deep into the small village, may be longer.

You can eat at the nearby eateries inside the ""Ngong Ping Village"", a mock-classical Chinese village but actually is a shopping mall. Or you can eat at some of the small eateries at the real Ngong Ping Village next to the Piazza. I think they serve regular non-vegetarian menus. But be warned that some of those eateries are run by the people who live there, may be borderline hole-in-the-wall environment. Tai O too. It is a small fishing village. Don't expect modern, ultra trendy types of outfits. At Tai O there will be more choices. But adjust your expectations. The place to have good food and modern settings would be in Tung Chung. There is a big mall (Citygate) and many eateries inside, including a food court. But that would be before you take the Ngong Ping 360 cable car or after you come back from Tai O (if you go that route, returning to Tung Chung)."

Re: How to get from Ngong Ping 360 to Tai O Village and more?,"+1 for taking the Mui Wo - Central ferry on your way back. Do try to time it to get an ordinary (slow) ferry for the much better views. Most have outdoor areas that you can sit, relax, and enjoy the ride. Also in this case you may take bus 15 from Central Ferry Piers up to The Peak, and later the Peak Tram down. Lines at the upper terminal tend to be much shorter than at the lower terminal, except shortly past sunset when the crowds want to go down."

The Airport Express is not running that early, and I found that the earliest bus (NA11) leaves at 4:50 from North Point and takes 80 minutes - so it should arrive at HK airport at around 6:10. I don't need to check in any baggage, but I'm worried that it might take long to go through immigration (I have a HK training visa) and/or maybe it's a long walk to the gates? Do you think I would make it on time, or should I take a taxi? I kinda wanted to avoid that option as it's far more expensive. Thanks in advance! Giulia"

Re: How long before flight should I arrive at HK airport?,"You can contact your airline to ask and confirm when they close the check-in for departing flights out of HKG airport. I believe most do so 60 minutes before departure. Further, if you don't have luggage to drop off and your airline provides online check-in before the flight, you can do that and use the boarding pass barcode on my mobile devise to proceed straight into the immigration/customs and restricted departure area as soon as your bus arrives at the airport. In that case, arriving an at 6.10am for a 7.35am flight is perfectly fine. Otherwise, you may be cutting it fairly close if you need to use the physical check-in counter to check into your flight and/or drop off luggage."

Re: Airport to Ngong Ping(with Luggage) & then Holiday Inn TST,"It is tempting because of the proximity. But none of those options would be good. You will find that you have to spend a lot of extra money (taxi, luggage storage fee, etc.) and at the end, it is more effort to get to your hotel (e.g. When you get back down to Tung Chung and get ready to go to Holiday Inn Golden Mile, taking the MTR, would need a transfer at Lai King and it is often crowded). 3pm check-in is not bad. By the time you reach TST, the hotel area, it will be already 2 pm unless you take a taxi. From the airport, you can take the Airport Bus A21 from the bus terminus, with your luggage, and go to Tsim Sha Tsui, alight at bus stop #15 ""Middle Road, Nathan Road"", walk to your hotel Holiday Inn Golden Mile Hong Kong is only 600 ft / 200 m. Even taxi can only save you 200m. Fare is HKD $34.6 per adult while taxi fare is about HKD $270 plus HKD $6 per luggage. Bus A21 only takes a little longer. This Airport Bus option will not be available if you go to Ngong Ping first. If you can switch, do Ngong Ping another day without the luggage burden may be better."

The visa is issued by mainland Chinese authorities in China just before passing through immigration control. The only difference between that and a VOA as done at some other countries is that the person issuing the visa is separate from the person stamping you in to the country. This is necessary, I guess because the VOA is not free and Immigration Officers at the stamping in counter are deemed unsuitable for handling payments. Other countries which have ""VOA with a fee"" generally have a similar arrangement (e.g. Indonesia, Thailand, etc) - queue once for the visa, then again to be stamped in. Most people in common parlance regard these ase VOA. Edited: 1 year ago"

Very simple: hop on an airport bus (both A11 or A12 would work, depending on where you are at North Point. A12 is quicker for your purpose, because it starts express non-stop after passing Victoria Park. A11 will meander through the heart of Causeway Bay, Wan Chai, etc before taking the Western Tunnel to shoot to the Airport. All Airport Bus, A11 and A12 included of course, make stop at the Hong Kong Port (to Exit Hong Kong Immigration and take the Golden Bus). You don't need any transfer. However, these buses will all make a stop at the Hong Kong Airport Terminal 1 (Departure Level) first where most of the passengers catching a plane will alight. Do not alight the bus at that point. Once you alight, you won't be able to catch another airport bus to Hong Kong Port because they are designed for Alight Only, no boarding (to Hong Kong Port, and then loop back to the Airport's Bus Terminus on ground level). = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = RE: ""Is the bus situation quite smooth as I know I have to get the golden bus over the bridge then a local bus at the other side?"" = = = = = Yes, once you have cross the border and Enter Macau, at that port facility you will find public buses 101X and 102X. And you will see the free hotel shuttle buses as well. However, these free hotel buses do not take you to the casino/hotel of your choice directly. They only take you to Macau Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal (MOHFT), or Taipa Ferry Terminal (2 routes). Then you need to alight and get on a different free hotel shuttle bus to your target hotel/casino. A 2-step process.

I see the sky terrace at Victoria peak only opens at 10am, so I am worried if we go too early we will miss out, and the shops might not be open.

Otherwise, all eateris are tugged inside some malls. There are 5-star hotel view restaurants with 5-star prices if you want some suggestions. At Star House (name of a building, next to Star Ferry), there are fast food at the basement (McDonalds, I think). Dim sum restaurant inside Hong Kong Cultural Centre. Along Canton Road, there are many restaurants along the street. Inside Harbour City (a shopping mall), there are restaurants. Or else walk along Ashley Road, Hankow Road, Lock Road - 3 short streets. There are many local eateries. Those are the areas closest to Avenue of the Stars (harbourfront)."

If you choose to do the Lugard Road walk, it takes roughly an hour. If you choose to go up higher, you can hike up Mt. Austin Road which should take 15-20 minutes.

Cathay's information is the current fact. Since they opened the HongKong-Zhuha-Macau Bridge, it becomes a ferry business killer. Passengers opt for land transportation over ferry directly from Airport to Macau. It is less expensive. Now Turbojet (ferry company) only runs HKIA to Macau with 1 sailing every Mon, Wed and Fri. Practically it is close to zero. You can still go from HKIA directly to Macau immediately. No need to stay in Hong Kong for one extra night. Going from the airport directly will save you a lot of time too. From the Airport, take B4 bus to the Hong Kong Port. Exit Hong Kong. Take Golden Bus to Macau Port using the HZM Bridge. Enter Macau. Then take taxi, public buses 101X or 102X, or 2-step hotel/casino free shuttle buses to your Macau destination. Takes a while, but no need to stay a night in Hong Kong first.

That is probably what your friend is talking about. However, they only have 3 sailings per week now (12.45am on Tues, Wed & Fri) so not very useful for most travellers going straight to Macau these days. You can see that sailing schedule on the TurboJet sailing schedule HKIA to/from Taipa ferry terminal in Macau below https://www.turbojet.com.hk/en/routing-sailing-schedule/hk-airport-macau/sailing-schedule-fares.aspx Note that they now have direct bus service from SkyPier at Hong Kong airport directly to the Macau side of the HZM Bridge that allows you to travel directly to Macau without passing through HK Immigration. This is a very new service and they are still working through how to make it work correctly but it is a substitute for the old SkyPier ferries that use the HZM Bridge (opened in 2018) just next to the airport. See link https://www.hongkongairport.com/en/transport/mainland-connection/transfer-coach-service.page Otherwise, if you want to spend less, you can exit the HK airport by passing through immigration, collecting your luggage and taking a short circular bus (B4) over over to the bridge. Then you use the Golden Shuttle Bus that runs 24 hours a day, directly to Macau. It is pretty quick, quite simple and much cheaper thand the direct SkyPier Airport transfer, but you do have to clear both HK and Macau immigration and carry your luggage yourself. That is the trade off. This is explained in the link I posted at the top near the top in the section called 'How to travel directly from HKIA (airport) to Macau. Edited: 1 year ago"

Re: Ferry from Hong Kong Airport to Macau,"@HappyFeet1234 @BradJill Thank you for the detailed information like always. So our flight will depart Bombay at 1:30 am and arrive in Hong Kong at 10:00 am which would already make this a tiring affair and since we are travelling with our 7 year old daughter I think it would be a better option to take the ferry from the airport rather than the bus which would require us to exit the airport and switch multiple transport on the way especially since we would be carrying our luggage ourselves as well. Also, since we will arrive at Hong Kong at 10:00 am, we will have enough time to catch the 12:45 pm ferry as well. I can have our hotel in Macau pick us up from the ferry terminal. I checked out the TurboJet website but cannot seem to find online booking option for HKIA to Macau Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal.

Re: Ferry from Hong Kong Airport to Macau,"""So we are thinking, why not stay in Hong Kong for say 07 nights and in between do a couple of day trips to Macau through ferry? Is this possible?"" It's possible, but not enjoyable. Bear in mind that each day trip will use roughly four hours of your time. (Getting to the ferry or bus, making the trip, going through immigration at BOTH ends each time.) A better course of action would be to reduce your Macau plans to a single stay, of one night or two. And spend the rest of the time in Hong Kong. ""Do we require a separate visa for Macau?"" Macau is a separate international jurisdiction. Just like going from India to Bangladesh. You require entry permission and will go through immigration every time you enter or leave. I don't THINK Indians require a visa in advance, but I would urge you to confirm this with experts on the Macau forum (or the Macau Immigration website.) ""Do we require to go through customs again on entry to Macau everytime?"" Yes. You will go through a check on both ends every time you travel HK-MC-HK. Edited: 1 year ago"

Is this possible?} & {""Do we require to go through customs again on entry to Macau everytime?""} Of course it is possible but day trips to Macau can be very tiring if you are unfamiliar with the city streets & transportation around Macau and have children with you. Just to make the trip, be ready for 4-5 hours of transportation and 4 immigration crossings (HK & Macau twice) per day trip. If you do two day trips, that 8-10 hours of transportation and 8 immigration crossings for something like 3-6 hours sightseeing each day, depending on how early you start and what mode of transportation you take back to HK. This can be very tiring and without a hotel in Macau to retreat to and rest, your kiddos might get really worn out, especially if you try to do this twice. This is why it makes a lot more sense, especially with children to just spend a night or two in Macau instead of making repeated day trips. If you really want to just stay at your hotel in Hong Kong. I would suggest just doing a single day trip to Macau. Have a look around, get one really big day there and then concentrate the rest of your time on sightseeing around Hong Kong. ""Do we require a separate visa for Macau?"" No prearranged visa nor PAR required for Indian Nationals. You will be granted 30 day stay limits for each entry into Macau.

The visit to the farm will take something like 2-3 hours typically. Then take the 64K again, continue to Tai Po. Get off at Ping On Lane, maybe visit the nearby Tin Hau temple, and walk towards Tai Po Central - that area is the beating heart of Tai Po. On the roof terrace of Tai Yuen Market is a nice selection of restaurants for a (late) lunch. Also very much worth visiting are Fu Shin Street with the Man Mo Temple and the railway museum and Tai Ming Lane Square and Tai Po Hui Market. That again is fairly close to Tai Po Market MTR station for a convenient trip back to TST. The 64K is one of the most scenic bus routes of Hong Kong, which is why I suggest to first go to Kam Sheung Road MTR. Kadoorie Farm is fine in the morning; Tai Po is much more lively in the afternoon and evening which is why this is my suggested order."

Coming off the Peak Tram and heading down be sure to wander through Hong Kong Park. Supposedly the walk-through aviary will be open again by next February. If so, don't miss it. Riding the upper deck of the HK tram is a great experience. I'd suggest riding eastward the entire length to Shaukeiwan then catching the MTR back. Just be sure to get on a tram marked ""Shaukeiwan."" With reclamation pushing the Star Ferry pier practically to Kowloon, it's no longer what it was. So if time is short just take the MTR to Kowloon side."

Places around that you might find interesting are the wet market, galleries, smaller shops, cafes and murals as you reach SoHo. Some might be interesting in PMQ as well which similar to the Central Market, houses various shops and restaurants. Tai Kwun (former police station with jail facilities) has tours and historical buildings. There are also museums around the area. Overall, I don't think there is one star attraction that is a must. But when you put the list together, it might offer you a pleasant 1/2+ day. However, it's something to be done later in the day when things start to open."

Dragon's Back is somewhat easier, shorter and simpler from a transport perspective. It's more of a half-day trip. If you would like to hike with other people then go on Meetup.com and look for the Hong Kong Hiking Meetup. They have hikes almost every day. There are also several other hiking groups there, but with not so many weekday hikes. Bear in mind (coming from Singapore) that we have significant hills here, so you may find hikes harder than anticipated unless you are used to hiking elsewhere. If the weather is clear then a great viewing point is the Ngong Ping Plateau above Sai Kung (a different one from the Ngong Ping on Lantau Island where the Big Buddha is). It is on both Stage 4 of the Maclehose Trail, and on the Ma On Shan Country Trail. Of course if you know you can do big hills then combining a trip (by cable car from Tung Chung) to the Big Buddha with a climb over Lantau Peak (Lantau Trail Stage 3 backwards) and then either over (Lantau Trail Stage 2 backwards) or round (South Lantau Country Trail, backwards) Sunset Peak to Nam Shan and then finishing (via the Nam Shan Village Trail) in Mui Wo for food then a ferry back to Central is good. There are literally hundreds of possibilities, so some guidance on distance, hill-climbing experience/ability and so on might enable us to narrow it down a bit."

I assume the budget of HK$2500-3000 is per night, because if that's for all 3 nights then 4* is probably a bit of a stretch. You really, really, need to get your head around using the world's best public transport system: it's much less hassle, and gives you much more flwxibility than any big group tours (and if they exist at all then the functional language of such a tour is likely to be Mandarin Chinese). For me the best location would be at Admiralty. Although the hotels there are 5* they are on top of the MTR station which means travel to Ocean Park and Disney is trivial, and you're also on the ding-ding tram and adjacent to the Peak Tram. It depends on your dates, but I see the J W Marriott at Admiralty/Pacific Place coming in at about $3000/night for a room for the 4 of you."

Re: Suggestion for Hotel in Hongkong,"The Peak area takes maybe 2 hours including roundtrip Peak Tram rides. If you decide to walk the Lugard Road loop or hike up Mt. Austin Road, allow an additional hour each. Avoid weekend afternoons when you are most likely to see a lot of people and potentially, Peak Tram queues. After the Peak Tram, you can perhaps take a ding ding tram ride on the Island side and visit an area like Wan Chai for a bit. Get yourself back to Central eventually for the Star Ferry to cross the harbour. From TST Star Ferry Pier, it should take no more than 30 minutes to walk the Avenue of Stars at the TST promenade. It's probably worthwhile to walk it during the day and then come back for the light show at 8pm. On another day head to Tung Chung for the cable car. The service starts at 10am. If you wake up early, you can look for a place for morning dim sum before your visit. After the cable car up, visit the Buddha and Po Lin Monastery. Tai O, a fishing village, is optional in my books but you might find it enjoyable. For the second half of that day, it depends on your other interests. Do you want to shop? See some museums?

Note that on weekdays the ferries from Sok Kwu Wan are not that frequent so you need to plan around that. https://hkkf.com.hk/en/timetables/ 5. I'm not sure about tickets, but I'm not convinced the harbour tour is worth the money. The waterfront promenade is walkable on both sides of the harbour, and you can simply take the normal Star Ferry for a small fraction of the price of the harbour tour in order to get across and back. 6. No. 7. Lantau Island and the Big Buddha/Tai O?"

Some eateries not opening on Sunday is quite specific to Central Market, just because of their location in the office district - pretty much everywhere else is open on Sunday. Lamma on Sunday means more ferries to/from Sok Kwu Wan, but also more people on the trail. You won't get lost. The restaurants in Sok Kwu are entirely seafood based.

There is no critical need for a map for this high traffic trail but you do have some options. If you start the hike at Yung Shue Wan and hike south and east to Sok Kwu Wan, there is a large island map just outside the main ferry pier that you can study and take a picture of to reference along the way. See image below https://en.tripadvisor.com.hk/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g294217-i143642849-Hong_Kong.html Unfortunately, I can't recall right now if they have the same posted map near the Sok Kwu Wan ferry piers or not. You can definitely get away with just following the signs however or use Google Maps just to feel extra comfortable with where you are going and where you are at any point in time during your hike. If you might want to go a bit off script and try a less trafficked splinter trail, definitely upload more details map apps like what wvmarle mentioned above or HikingTrailHK these will have you covered if you want to get a bit off the main grid on Lamma Island. Last simple island trail maps option is to simply reference online maps beforehand and download them to your mobile phone. Here is one that marks the main route and most highlight stops well. It sort passes over the Lo So Shing Beach which I personally like more than the popular Hung Shing Yeh Beach.

Re: 3 days in December,"Day 1: realistically it'll be about 13:00, maybe closer to 14:00 by the time you arrive on Lamma to start your walk, so the seafood part is going to be dinner: off the ship by 9, at your hotel maybe 10, check in, settle in, make your way to the ferry pier, by when it'll be past noon. With a little luck you just miss your ferry and have to wait half an hour for the next. With a stop for lunch and some sight-seeing/shopping in Yung Shue Wan you're talking about dinner for your seafood, and with the ferry ride back (they're infrequent from Sok Kwu Wan) easily 21:00 by the time you can board the bus. What you have planned for day 2 is not much; I suggest you to swap those two days. Walk the streets of Central on your first day (when you really only have the afternoon), and take a mid-morning ferry to Lamma on your second day. Gives you much more time to enjoy this little island. On a nice day you may even hang out on the beach for a while, in the sun it can be really nice even in December. I like the Star Ferry cruise but wouldn't pay extra for the Symphony of Lights. Rather watch that from the shore. I don't think it's that impressive anyway; the lit-up skyline itself is what it's about, really. As it's December it'll be dark well before 18:00 so you may consider an earlier evening cruise ending in TST, then if you don't have enough of it watch the Symphony of Lights from the TST waterfront, and have a late dinner."

Re: HK airport to lo Wu .,"MTR is the way to go because you need it to do the last leg to Lo Wu Border. No other public transportation is allowed except MTR trains. But using MTR via the Central Station (I think you meant Hong Kong Station from the Airport) is a big round-about way. A more efficient way is to take Airport Bus A43 (Long Wan Bus Company), from the Airport Bus Terminus. It pretty much runs express to Sheung Shui MTR Station, where you alight, walk into the MTR Station to buy tickets and take the MTR train for 1 stop from Sheung Shui to Lo Wu. Then you walk across the border to Shenzhen. Link to LWB route search, enter ""A43"" for details: https://search.kmb.hk/kmbwebsite/index.aspx?lang=en"

RE: your brother's suggestion - "" My brother told me to a bus to Hung Hom and then take the MTR to Lo Wu."" That is a pretty big round-about way. You are taking a different airport bus (A21) to go east, and then a train to go north. The total time: headway for A21 is maybe 15 minutes, riding time ~90 minutes. transfer time 10 minutes to MTR. Riding time from MTR to Sheung Shui (and then Lo Wu) is another 50 minutes or so. They all make intermediate stops. You are looking at a 2.5 hour plus journey. With A43 airport bus, headway may be long (30 minute per departure), but once the bus departs, that's pretty much, virtually, non-stop going north-east to Sheung Shui MTR Station. The bus ride is about 40 minutes or so. You walk into the MTR Station at Sheung Shui, 10 minutes. As for Sheung Shui MTR Station being busy... yes it is. But most of the riders of the train alight at Sheung Shui Station, not to the border at Lo Wu. You may not get a seat on this MTR ride, but you certainly can get on the train (it is a metro, short-haul subway/train). The ride from there to Lo Wu is really short. Maybe 3 minutes. Even if you need to stand, it is just 3 minutes! Given your Shenzhen hotel's location, I would proceed with taking MTR to Lo Wu like you originally envisioned. Going to Lo Ma Chau / Futian crossing will not help you."

If you have a lot of luggage, it will be somewhat difficult to use public transportation to cross the harbour from one side to the other. Otherwise, no direct routes by way of bus or MTR so will require a change or two and some walking as well. As it seems you have learned so far, there is Sun Ferry service from North Point to Hung Hom (see sailing schedule link below).

Re: Transportation From HKG Airport to Kowloon?,"USRGiants, Best to become familiar with Google maps before your trip to HK (see link) https://www.google.com/maps Type in Kerry Hotel and then click the direction button while viewing the hotel location on the map. You can then type in where you are coming from. Type in Hong Kong International Airport. Google Maps will then create a direction map with various options including (foot, car, train and bus) so you can review different transportation recommendations to the hotel. You can adjust travel time as well while reviewing transportation options when deciding which is the best transportation option for you personally. Note, I'd also recommend downloading CityMapper to your mobile phone. https://citymapper.com When you arrive in Hong Kong, open the app and it will set for Hong Kong. This is a useful app to use locally and functions similarly to Google Maps but also provides estimated taxi fares which can be useful if you plan on using this form of transport while in the city.

I don't rate this option as practical since you will likely get lost and not like dragging bags for this sort of distance. If you want to go cheap then, take A21 bus to Hung Hom station and change to a taxi there. The cost difference at the end is probably around HKD100-120. Taxi is the easiest for sure. Pay by the meter plus luggage fee. No need to tip."

Re: HKIA to Regal Riverside Hotel Sha Tin,"For this particular hotel, the Airport Bus A41 works well. They have a bus stop named ""Regal Riverside Hotel"" right across the street from the hotel. Couldn't be any better. You walk down to the ground level (on a ramp) or take the elevator to the ground level from the Arrival Hall. Follow the signs for ""Bus"". The airport bus terminus is right at the bottom of the ramp. Find the bay for A41. There are luggage racks on the these airport buses. It is okay to roll your free luggage carts (from the Baggage Claim Carousels) with your bags all the way down the ramp to the Bus Terminus. No problem. You leave those empty luggage carts at the bus terminus and some airport workers will take care of retrieving them. You need some local cash (HKD) to pay for the bus fare. Children below age of 12 pays half price. No extra charge for the luggage. Or you can get your Octopus Cards (one car per person, the child aged 10 gets the Child Octopus Card) at the airport and use Octopus Cards to pay for the bus fares. This link will send you to the KMB's (the bus company) route search page. Click on the bus icon for search. Enter ""A41"" and you will see all the bus stop details and the route plotted on a map.

There is quite certainly no ocean line between the two places, those services are very rare nowadays for any distance longer than a day or two (and those are primarily for trucks and people wanting to bring their car along for international travel, which is quite a common thing in Europe)."

The main thing I think you should be worried about is medical expenses: if you have an accident or fall ill, you will have to pay full fare for the hospitals, and that will get expensive, fast. Now it is entirely possible that this is covered by your local health insurance (I have no idea how that works in India), if so there is in my opinion far less reason to take travel insurance. Other key benefits are cancellations and evacuations, both which are not usually an issue for a 3-month stay which for its length I suppose is not basic tourism."

Also, the roads are often congested. Even if you use Google Map to navigate, you are still going to get lost and possibly, break traffic laws because Google Map is known to have bugs. It has asked me to make illegal turns in the past. To expand on traffic laws, the police do pull people over for various transgressions that might not be strictly enforced overseas. They include crossing solid lines, driving in bus lanes, and staying in the fast lane for a prolonged period not overtaking. There are also many red light and speed cameras. Illegal parking and stopping are strictly enforced nowadays. I don't dare to leave my car for more than a few minutes now. Finally, even if feel you have gotten lucky with something illegal, many drivers around you have car cameras installed. You might still get reported and fined at a later date through your rental company. Overall, driving is a bad idea if you don't know the local customs.

Yes I also understand that the need to visit as a tourist may not be considered a genuine ""need"" in normal terms, but I love to travel (I have made three trips overseas in this year, all with my family) and Hong Kong is the closest global city from my hometown (Hanoi). So, for me, a people who do leisure travel quite a lot, having a multiple entry visa to Hong Kong is a genuine ""need"", as it would allow me to reach a global city after just 2 hour flight. I will be able to take a Friday night flight to Hong Kong and spend the weekend chilling there before fly back home in Sunday night. Currently, without a multiple entry visa to Hong Kong, the closest Tier 1 global city I can reach is Singapore, after a 4-hours flight. I can reach Taipei after 3 hours, but I consider Taipei to be Tier 2. All other global cities such as Tokyo, Seoul, Sydney.... will be at least 4.5 hours away from me and I cannot do a quick trip there in the weekend. So, to make it short, as a active traveller, I have a genuine need to visit a global city every month just to chill there and stay far away from all the work-related stress, and having a multiple entry visa to Hong Kong will be a game changer for me, because Hong Kong is pretty close to my hometown."

This didn't present a problem as we didn't have much on our agenda for our three full days in Hong Kong. The hotel was just a couple of blocks from the Fa Yuen street market which is best known for discounted clothing but also has plenty of fruits stands where we immediately loaded up on lychees and yang mei. After lunch we met up with another one of Mei Ling's old friends and his family and spent the afternoon bumming around Sham Shui Po, another busy commercial neighborhood just north of Mong Kok. There was another multilevel food market here called Pei Ho with its own food court. After dinner we made an exhausting climb up hundreds of stairs to the top of Woh Chai Shan, an incongruous forested hill adjacent to the busy commercial district of Sham Shui Po. Standing among the trees gazing out on the dense rows of residential apartment towers gave a new perspective on the term ""urban jungle"". On Sunday morning we roused ourselves at a more reasonable time in order to spend the day on Lantau Island with another of Mei Ling's old friends. This mountainous, sparsely populated island is best known to foreigners as the site of Hong Kong Disneyland but also has a famous monastery and several small fishing villages. We took Hong Kong's efficient and clean metro to a heavily developed section of the island called Tung Chung where the departure station of the Ngong Ping cable car is located. The cable car travels three and a half miles to the top of the Ngong Ping plateau, the highest point on Lantau. We paid a little extra for a Crystal Cabin which has a glass floor and floor-to-ceiling glass walls. It was well worth the extra expense because the panoramic views of Lantau were spectacular. It was like King Kong's island with clusters of towering white skyscrapers. Below us we could see more intrepid travelers making the journey up the mountain by foot. After lunch at a noddle restaurant we made our way to the main attraction of the plateau, the Po Lin monastery. This Buddhist monastery was found just a century ago by traveling monks from Jiangsu province. The Tian Tan Buddha was completed in 1993 and has already become one of Hong Kong's most well-known features. The statue is over a hundred feet tall and sits atop a platform that can only be reached by climbing two hundred and sixty-eight steps upward from the monastery. It was quite a brutal ascent but eventually we all made it and spent a few minutes catching our breath at the top. Back at Ngong Ping we boarded a bus to Tai O village. The colorful fishing boats and wooden houses on stilts had lots of visual appeal and were dutifully being photographed by clumps of tourists at every vantage point. The village has a daily market that is largely dedicated to souvenirs, herbal remedies, and street foods and probably isn't very useful to the residents aside from being a source of income. We did try the local specialty of fish maw soup which was quite tasty. We had a pleasant ferry ride between Lantau and Hong Kong Island with interesting close-up views of some of the smaller uninhabited islands. The skyline of the island was as impressive as I remembered it from my last visit in 2008. We checked out a few of the most famous streets in the Central neighborhood which featured some impressive street art. One memorable spot was Wing Lee Street which was actually a pedestrian walkway through a 1950's housing development. Ultimately we decided we would just eat in Mong Kok again and we made our way back to Central Pier for the short ferry ride across Victoria Harbor. I knew there was a nightly light show at the harbor called ""A Symphony of Lights"" at eight but I didn't know exactly what it was or the best place to see it. The best thing we could think of for our last few hours in Hong Kong was to walk all the way down to Tsim Sha Tsui on the waterfront. The only notable stop we made on the walk down was at the Nelson Street wet market, one of the largest outdoor markets in Hong Kong and probably the most enjoyable for us on this visit. It was a short walk to the Harbour Promenade, which is all that many visitors see of Kowloon. A statuesque bronze replica of the Hong Kong Film Awards statue marked the entrance to the Avenue of Stars, a knockoff of the Hollywood Walk of Fame that features the handprints of over a hundred Chinese movie stars set at intervals along the waterfront. We had a similar view of the Hong Kong Island skyline that we had from the ferry but more time to appreciate it from a variety of angles. Behind the Avenue of Stars was the K11 Musea shopping mall which prominently featured several luxury brands and a large empty space in the center that a small plane could have flown through. We hooked around the mall to find a route back to Nathan Street from which we could get a double decker bus back to Mong Kok. Here there was one more open plaza with a backdrop of futuristic Kowloon skyscrapers, our final taste of Hong Kong's postmodern edge.

DB which is full of expats is likely to be far more Christmassy than the more local Mui Wo. Then the 5-star Hyatt Regency at University MTR station is a good hotel at a rather quiet location, but no sight-seeing or even restaurant options in the direct area. You'll need to travel a lot. Other rather quiet hotels but I think not good for you (just adding it for completion) include the Warwick on the island of Cheung Chau, and the heritage hotel in Tai O - no direct taxi access, it's a 20-minute walk or a short speed boat ride from the bus/taxi stop. Both those areas will get crowded on weekends and you happen to be there on a weekend. There's also a hotel near Sai Kung, which is quite far from the airport and also crowded on weekends.

Higher floors give significantly better views in the Peninsula and the Mandarin; doesn't make so much difference in the Four Seasons and the Rosewood. The Peninsula and the Mandarin are seen as slightly more ""traditional"" in their service. The Peninsula and the Rosewood are located in TST which is a bustling commercial area. The Mandarin and the Four Seasons are adjacent to the central business district. All are reasonably well-located for public transport (primarily the MTR/subway); it's a slightly longer walk from the Four Seasons to the main MTR line but it's adjacent to the city terminaus of the express railway in from the airport.

The In-Town check-in has always worked like a charm and since you are right there at Airport Express (Hong Kong Station) which will have you at the airport in scheduled 24 minutes.

Re: ATMs without additional fee,"Cash advance via a credit card withdrawal is typically considered a laon. You almost always incur a very high interest rate. The only trick that might avoid the charge is if you prepay some money into the credit card in advance. However, it's much simpler to use a *dedicated* ATM debit card. Many years ago, I had a combo credit/debit card that allowed me to pull money using the debit function at home. Once overseas, the debit options disappeared on the foreign ATM screen so I was left with credit card advance (loan) as the only expensive option. With a debit card, if it has the Plus, Cirrus or Union Pay logos, then you can withdraw at bank machines with no additional charges locally. Note that even if your home bank doesn't charge a transaction fee, you will still be pay a small premium for the currency exchange which is no big deal."

Re: ATMs without additional fee,For credit card cash withdrawals at ATMs you would need a PIN code otherwise only over-the-counter cash advances are possible. My credit card from Mega Bank Taiwan doesn't have a PIN code and they also don't offer any PIN code upon request. This could be problematic in Europe as they don't have over-the-counter cash advances in Europe. The best in order to get cash are debit cards. Each debit card has a PIN code so they work at ATMs. Also ATMs should usually work 24 hours whereas over-the-counter cash advances are probably not available during late night

Re: ATMs without additional fee,"I think that all credit cards charge interest on cash withdrawals from the moment the cash is withdrawn. So even if you aren't charged a withdrawal fee, you will be paying interest of something like 25% APR until you pay it back - and if you already have an outstanding balance on your card, the withdrawal won't be paid back until the rest of the balance is cleared! It's much better to look for a debit card with a zero or low fee for foreign currency transactions."

The journey takes 3 hours 5 minutes due to need to cross immigration and customs. With a large group riding the bus, it can take a bit of time. However, One Bus, which I believe has the earliest departure at 8am would put in a bit late for the TeamLab time slot of 11am at Venetian. As such, I'd recommend just making way to the HKZ Bridge near HKIA airport and using the 24 hour Golden Shuttle Bus service over the bridge to Macau. The ride is 45 minutes, allow 15 minutes to clear immigration, purchase bus ticket and board on the Hong Kong side. Departures are every 3-5 minutes in the morning so you won't have to wait long to be on your way. On the Macau side, allow 15 minutes to clear immigration and exit the building. As of my trip last week, I was seeing Venetian shuttle buses at the HZMB Macau Port. You should be able to use them for direct free transfer to the Venetian. Departures are probably every 15 minutes or so and the ride is around 15-20 minutes to Venetian. Otherwise, take a taxi from the Macau Port, it will similarly take around 15-20 minutes to the Venetian. Regardless, if you leave by 7am from your hotel in Hong Kong, you will make it to the Venetian with plenty of time to spare.

As to taxi availability, it depends on the time of day, where you are waiting and the specific route. Should you use a regular taxi on the street, ensure they charge you based on the metered rate (plus tunnels, bridges, luggage, etc where applicable)."

However, out in the country parks which have controlled vehicle entrance beyond Pak Tam Chung things can get tricky, especially on late weekend afternoons when day visitors and hikers come crawling out of the country parks to the main roads seeking a ride back into Sai Kung village.

There are some pretty spectacular views over the south Lantau coastline as the bus crawls up and over the mountains around Pak Tam Au and escape lanes in case vehicles lose control on the very steep descent. Double deckers also now operate on route 4 along the south coast between Mui Wo and Tong Fuk although thats not a frequent service.

You can enjoy the endless sea view and enjoy the sunset without the obstruction of high-rise buildings. "" Right... the fine print is ""(No boarding or alighting)"". Enjoy the sunset on a moving bus.

Or in the case of Disneyland to NP360, $150 x 4 = $600 for a family of 4, instead of taking a taxi for ~$140. Transportation service. I just see this in the same light as the Kai-Tak Macau Seaplane project. Only time will tell.

Your choices from the airport are the Airport Express to Kowloon Station then a taxi, or a taxi direct, or (if you prefer to pay a premium and have extra hassle at the airport for no good reason) then Uber. Since there appears to be at least 2 of you then a taxi is probably the best option. The Macau Ferry terminal is attached to Sheung Wan MTR station. The MTR app gives very reliable timings for rides.

Taxis are generally easy to find right outside MTR stations, no need to try and book a car and hope they show up and hope you can talk to them on the phone (you need a local phone number for that part) well enough so they have the same idea about where exactly to pick you up as you.

Re: MTR or Uber,"If anyone would like to know, here is my experience: Travelling with four people on MTR is not worth it due to the price. Uber was fine most places, but sometimes there is a confusion with the pickup point. Sometimes the app just not find a driver in time, so don't leave your travel plans for the last minute. Give yourself an extra 30 minutes. And as for the metered taxis, they are all cash and the experience is varied. Some do not want to speak English, and some do not speak English at all. Some drivers are rude and in a big hurry, so expect to be shooed off if they don't understand your destination or they just don't like your face. An aside note: people who have an expectation of paying with credit card for food and merchandise may be bitterly disappointed. Many stores do not take Mastercard, even one MacDonalds, so carry extra cash or use Octopus or Alipay. Seems to me a defiance against Western forms of payments. Also there is a 7% commission to exchange cash, so beware. And as for the person who said ""You obviously come from a country with no functioning public transport"" - my country's public transport functions just fine, thank you very much. I just wanted to know how yours functions. There was no need to be rude. Or maybe there is a need... maybe just a culture thing, if I have to go with the generally bad experience I had with metered taxis."

Re: MTR or Uber,"I'm sorry, but if you're claiming that 4 people on an MTR ride is more expensive than a taxi/uber ride then you're doing something wrong in almost every case. (The exception would be the Airport Express, but that's a special case, not really the core MTR). And why wait 30 minutes for a car? The MTR can get you between almost all the tourist areas in less time than that. Same for the 7% commission on currency exchange - you clearly were doing something wrong unless you were trying to exchange a rather rare and/or very volatile currency (for example the ZAR). Or maybe you made the rookie mistake of exchanging cash at the airport - that gets you terrible rate pretty much anywhere in the world. For USD I would expect the cash spread to be about 2%.

Just a tip to others - there is no need to buy any express pass in Disneyland as the rides are mostly 5 mins wait only (we bought & could not refund) - we went on a weekday. We did not enjoy Tai O very much as there is pretty much nothing to do except for a boat ride and most shops are closed. We are worried that Cheung Chau Island would be the same as Tai O. Would you please advise if Cheung Chau Island would be very similar to Tai O or if Sai Kung would be more interesting instead? We will be going this Monday.

All these cut into their profit margins for their small business. Those would be like any local eateries you can walk by and hop-in from the streets (especially in non-tourist areas). The chained, big corporate-run restaurants/fast-food would likely take credit cards. Especially those set up in malls. It is usually easy to tell: if they take credit cards, usually they stick those credit card company logos (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, as well as some Japanese/European brands) in front of the reception counter, cashier counter, or on the window pane or by the entrance door where you can see them before you walk in.

On weekdays, there just isn't enough demand for some of the stores to open. Personally, I don't particularly rate Tai O as a must unless the visitor doesn't have much experience going to a fishing village in other places. Lamma is a good spot to go regardless of the day. In fact, weekdays are probably better due to lesser crowds. I like Lamma more than Cheung Chau myself as well. If you go to Lamma, take the ferry to one spot, hike the island and leave from the other side. Our spending habits vary. In HK though, most locals understand that you will need cash if you want to go to cha chann teng and many small eateries. Many of them (but not all) take Octopus nowadays. As a visitor, you will probably need cash to reload the Octopus. I do use a credit card to reload myself through a payment app. For stationery (but probably lean towards art supply), you can go to Chung Nam at 503 Nathan Road (Yau Ma Tei). Otherwise, if you just walk around Mong Kok, Yau Ma Tei, Jordan, etc, you will find small stores scattered here and there. For Eslite, they have a location at the Star House just a short walk from Star Ferry. For general books, search for Commercial Press locations. If you happen to be at the Island side, at Wan Chai's Johnston Road, go to Cosmos Books. For dim sum, I do recommend Reunion Garden at Hillwood Road between Jordan and Tsim Sha Tsui. It's a mid+ kind of place so not fancy but definitely not a dump. Another spot in Tsim Sha Tsui is New Bamboo Garden at Observatory Road. They are a little cheaper but surprisingly good."

I thought that was very inefficient as it was taking quite some time to collect the physical tickets. It was quite crowded when we go up on a weekday.

Watch the HK Observatory a couple days before your hike. That is the only way to tell what sky (cloudy) and temperature conditions will be. What you wear is very much dependant on how susceptible you are to cooler temperatures in the early morning and the wind. Many of us hike in shorts and t-shirts on the main trails like Dragon's Back throughout the hiking season unless it is say... 12 degrees or below and early in the morning when it is much cooler than later in the morning after the sun comes up. At 11am, it should be fairly pleasant unless we are having a winter monsoon and that doesn't seem be in the forecast right now. If you have hiking pants with detachable legs, that can work really well if you are concerned about feeling cold. These allow you to start with legs in the early morning when its coolest and then detach, using shorts later on when you feel too warm."

Coming from Macau by bounded direct bus, you are bypassing HK immigration and arriving within the restricted area of HKIA airport. the MTR Customer Service counter is in the unrestricted area of the airport so unfortunately you won't have access to that area when arriving at the airport this way. Your best bet is to try to turn in your On Loan Octopus Card on the way out of Hong Kong to Macau. This can be done simply. Turn in your card prior to heading out to the HZMB or ferry terminal depending on how you plan to go to Macau. Pay bus fare or taxi with cash to get from your HK hotel to those border crossings."

Taxi is recommended if you stay at Hong Kong Shangri-La. Not as convenient and more expensive if you are staying at Kowloon Shangri-La because it needs to go through Cross Harbour Tunnel. But if you have a lot of luggage in tow, perhaps the taxi option is better. You have a decision to make: 2 options - ferry sailing to Macau Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal (MOHFT). Or to Taipa Ferry Terminal. Turbojet serves primarily MOHFT. Cotajet serves only Taipa Ferry Terminal. Schedule information here: Turbojet: https://www.turbojet.com.hk/en/routing-sailing-schedule/hong-kong-macau/sailing-schedule-fares.aspx Cotaijet: https://www.cotaiwaterjet.com/ferry-schedule/hongkong-macau-taipa.html Since you are going to St Regis, sailing to Taipa is highly recommended. It is much closer to your hotel, and you have more options to reach your hotel from the pier. There are free hotel shuttles (check St Regis Hotel website on the information). I think the shuttle service is pooled with other hotels under ""Cotai Central"" (that's the name of their complex, with 3 to 4 hotels). Or you can take a taxi there, it is not too far. To your hotel front door. Also available (though I don't recommend them because you need to walk a bit, with luggage): Macau's light rail ""Macao LRT"", and public buses. = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = Going from Macau to Hong Kong Airport: You can only take the ferry route if your airline supports SkyPier. if your airline doesn't support it, there is no check-in counter at SkyPier to check you in.

Try not to take the ferry to Sheung Wan and then go to the airport as that would be inefficient."

The response has generally been that gyms in HK didn't market short-term entries -- they were focused on long-term contracts. I'm happy to say that on my current trip to HK, I've found a very workable solution. There's a new gym chain called Go24fitness that now has a series of gyms in many different parts of the SAR (but not Central). They welcome day visitors (for HK$200) , and they also sell weekly and one-month passes, which are much more economical. They are open 24 hours but to get set up with an entry pass I recommend going during their weekday business hours. Anybody who's interested can find full info by googling Go24fitness. They also have an upscale branch called Onyx, located in the Taikoo Place complex in Quarry Bay. That one is a tad more expensive but it is very nice indeed -- it has only been open a couple of months and so the machines are all new and the lockers/showers are immaculately clean."

Second - There is a new SkyPier direct coach service taking arriving passengers from HKIA straight to Macau over the bridge, bypassing HK Immigration altogether. This service operates on the hour, must be arranged at the SkyPier counter immediately upon arrival at HKIA (don't proceed through immigration). Cost is around HK$280 per adult.

Re: From HKG airport to Kowloon Harbourfront Hotel?,"A21 airport bus will take you there. Bus Stop #20 is also their terminus, the end point of this route, Hung Hom MTR Station (and bus terminus). To set up a better expectation: my small warning: there is ~ 0.5 mile of walk from the bus terminus to this hotel, via some pedestrian walkways that can be not-straight-forward to navigate. You won't be walking on street surface but a series of connecting walkpaths. The building layout, roads, pedestrian paths in that corner of Hong Kong is one of the most confusing, from layers of add-ons through out several decades. You may want to research and rehearse how to walk from the bus terminus to this hotel. Or else on your travel day, and especially after dark (past 7 pm), I can bet you will be lost and had to back-track in some way trying to find your hotel. Maybe ask this hotel and see if they have written directions for guests to walk there from the Hung Hom Station."

Re: From HKG airport to Kowloon Harbourfront Hotel?,"The hotel offers a shuttle bus service that goes to Harbour Plaza Metropolis (near where A21 terminates) and Middle Road (which is a stop along the A21 route). Using the Middle Road stop is probably the easier and definitely faster solution if you can manage to cross Nathan Road and find the bus stop. Otherwise, the HP Metropolis Hotel is a sister hotel operation so they can surely guide you to the bus stop. Note that from the A21 terminus bus stop, you need to go up the elevator or the escalator, cross the bridge into the shopping mall, and then follow the signs to the hotel. https://www.harbour-plaza.com/kowloonharbourfront/files/brochure_files/224/en/KHFH%20ENG.pdf https://www.harbour-plaza.com/metropolis/files/brochure_files/222/en/Location%20Map%202021.pdf But if you do decide to walk from the bus stop, you also need to go into the mall first and then head out the other way near Hung Luen Road.

I appreciate this is much longer than most people come to HK for, but I used to live here and it's rarely going to be a trip for a few days if I can help it. On this occasion, my return was primarily to scatter my father's ashes in HK after he died nearly 3 years ago in Scotland. I won't go into the process of arranging it here (anyone who wants to know can message me privately) but in some ways it wasn't the most straightforward of tasks and I'm glad we had booked to stay for 12 nights as the process can take a wee while to organise. The relevant HK govt dept were, however, good at rushing through the paperwork to get the permission, once all the other hoops are jumped through. We stayed at the Royal Garden in TST East. We had stayed here before and we're quite happy with the location etc. I've posted a separate review of it but we enjoyed our stay. The weather was wonderful while we were there. A balmy mid 20s and not a spot of rain. A welcome relief after all we've endured for the last 9 months or so in Scotland. It might have been better if it had been blue skies all the time but I can't complain and it definitely felt warmer than past Novembers from my childhood. Always a haze so photos weren't as good as in the past. Admin aside, which took up chunks of a few days, as this was the 6th visit for my husband, I decided it might be nice to see and do things we've never done, and indeed places I've not been to in 40 odd years. We went to Kadoorie Farm, which was a nice change, boy was it a steep walk down from the top (we got the shuttle bus up)! We especially enjoyed the aviaries which have interesting notes about the birds' background and they are great enclosures, especially compared to the zoological gardens in HK Island. We went to Tai Po too and enjoyed wandering the markets there, much more fun than in the city although it was a big thumbs down from my husband for the train museum!😂 We took a trip over to Lamma Island one day and did the walk from one ferry point to the other, nothing too arduous and enough to build up an appetite for lunch. Just a simple lunch of squid, vegetables and rice but utterly delicious. We went mid week in case it got a lot more crowded at the weekend. We went to Stanley one Saturday, not so much to see Stanley as it's not like it was 40 years ago, but the bus journey there is always enjoyable. I was concerned it might be very busy as we went on a Saturday, but it was so quiet it was quite peculiar, although very welcome. I was shocked by the amount of new buildings around that area and Repulse Bay, but then again it's been at least 10 years since I was there last so no doubt it has been a gradual progression. And the fancy boats in the bays-wow! Thankfully tourists numbers were not back to what they were at their peak and while the harbour had a buzz about it, we found most places comfortably busy, although I'm sure many shops and restaurants etc would prefer more customers. The Peak was heaving when we went, but once you start off on the circular route, the numbers peter out and there were spells where we were on our own (I did wish I had kept a little portion of ashes to scatter there rather than the Cape Collinson memorial gardens which held little meaning to me. But I know- not allowed!!) HK races- we have no great interest in horse racing but enjoy the spectacle that is Happy Valley. So off we went on a Wed night to discover the $10 entry fee was waived. Not sure if that's been the case for a while. We stayed for a few races but I was disappointed by the choice of food. It seemed to cater for the more international taste, which is fine, but there wasn't even a Chinese rice dish to enjoy. Still, an excuse to indulge in a rare Big Mac for me. Next time I think we will go for the later races as it was definitely getting busier as we left. The lovely egg tarts- we sampled many, since it's not something we often get here in Scotland of decent quality. They ranged in price from $12 in Central, to $4.50 (Sham Shui Po or Tai Po, I can't recall). Have to say the higher price one wasn't anything to write home about and the other ones were just as good, and probably better. We often skipped our dinner as we had a bigger than normal breakfast, followed by a late lunch. At the time it was fine, but in hindsight I realise now I should have taken every opportunity to enjoy even the simplest dinner of wonton meen. How I wish I had a bowl of it now!! We also visited the relatively new HK Palace Museum. Getting there was pretty straightforward. The return bus, however, was a long wait of 45 mins, not ideal. Should have hopped on a mini bus to the MTR station. That aside, it was an enjoyable few hours. We went as we had seen an ad for the National Gallery Botticelli exhibition and this appealed to my husband. We had a few spare days so it was a nice thing to do for a change. In hindsight I should have let him do that exhibition on his own as I was a tad bored, but I enjoyed the permanent exhibitions of HK ceramics and Forbidden City much more than he did. Due to the timings, we had to rush through these at the end (although I did still spend over an hour) but I would certainly go back to it. A striking building too. Speaking of museums, the HK history museum was unfortunately shut on this trip as I would have gone back to that. Next time! We also went to the maritime museum but I mainly enjoyed the more recent stuff. On our last day, as our flight was not until midnight, and my husband was not up for wandering through any more markets, we decided just to hop on the trams and watch the world go by. We went from Central to Whitty St depot, then a tram to way past Causeway Bay and then back again. It whiled away a few hours and was quite enjoyable. I personally would have preferred more wandering around Mong Kok and Sham Shiu Po but I wasn't going to push my luck! One final observation- my husband was able to make use of the Elderly Octopus card and it was incredibly good value to have most fares capped at $2, even the Lamma ferry. He wasn't smug at all! And the discounts for museums etc were great although still a bargain at full price. The MTR was great, as usual, and the Star Ferry was so quiet it seemed quite sad. Having said that, a running jump now could see you make it over the harbour. I'm not so keen on the ever increasing reclaimed land on HK island, but perhaps this is just what happens when you return and things change. In summary, a wonderful trip back to where I was born and brought up, and I was sad to leave. Our last visit was Nov'19 so this was quite a contrast with no protests to avoid etc, and the city did have more of a buzz to it, but thankfully, for us, it wasn't back to its peak tourist numbers. Wonder what things will be like when I return in hopefully 2-3 years….. Thanks again to all the regulars on this forum as I trawled for a while for relevant up to date information. This was meant to be brief but it's very long so I do apologise!"

Our flight got in at 7:30 in the evening and baggage - immigration was pretty simple. After picking up our pre-reserved wifi hotspot, and getting some cash from an atm, we headed to the taxi stand which was very well organized. Getting cash at one of the multiple atms was simple. We were staying at the Courtyard Marriott (see review) in Sai Ying Pun in Hong Kong. So instead of trying to figure out the public transportation options, we opted to take a taxi which was relatively cheap. Make sure to take the red-colored taxis if going to HK island. The fare indicated was accurate at about 325 HKD (about $45 USD) if I recall correctly. We got to the hotel and checked in by 8:30pm. Since we were hungry we decided to walk a little ways to one of the multiple small restaurants still open and located on Des Voeux Rd next to the Courtyard- all locals. I had the mistaken impression that Mandarin had become more widely used in Hong Kong only to find that Cantonese was still the primary language. Not that it mattered because we don't speak either one despite being ethnically Chinese - American born. In any case, we found a small soup noodle shop and managed despite the language barrier (lots of pointing and observing what the locals were doing). Two large soup noodle bowls with pork for about 85 HKD ($11 US) - Very cheap! Note: We had pre-reserved a wifi hotspot and we found the kiosk pretty easily (directions on your confirmation) on the arrivals floor. We showed my confirmation email, received the hotspot, fired it up and it worked like a charm. What's nice about this is that both my wife and I could be connected whereas before we would each need to get a SIM. It allowed up to 5 devices, the speed was good throughout, and just needed to charge it overnight. It worked in Macau also. It was a great option if you have multiple family members needing connectivity. Day One: We had not yet purchased our Octopus card so we went to the Sai Ying Pun MRT station. We purchased them at the counter (had to use cash - no credit card). We had a 10 am meeting at Lippo Centre in Central, to tend to some family business. We were done by 11 and since we were already pretty close by, we took the short walk over to the Peak Tram. This was a Friday and it was overcast. So maybe this is why the que was not long at all -no waiting. Everyone got into the first tram available. The overcast conditions also made the overall weather pretty cool and bearable. The few times the sun came out I felt the heat and humidity pretty rapidly. We also purchased the ticket that included the Sky Terrace which I think was worthwhile. It gives you the best unencumbered view of everything below. And even though it wasn't too sunny or clear, the views are still pretty stunning. Too bad you couldn't see much beyond Kowloon very well. Predictably, it is very commercialized at the top with the mall, food shops and stores. We did hike along the Lugard Rd Hong Kong Trail a bit. But I think we turned back before reaching the Lugard Rd Lookout. We hadn't done our research well. In any case, we were getting hungry and wanted to go to a dimsum place. So back down the tram. So here is a warning on using Google maps. The app is great for directions and for letting you know which bus or train to take, etc. But while on foot, it is more challenging to follow, especially in a place like Hong Kong with lots of elevation. I didn't think we were getting good GPS location at times. Plus there are a lot of twisting intersection roads and underpasses - and Maps doesn't think in 3D. So beware. In retrospect, we might have used taxis more often. It took us 30 mins of walking to find the right bus stop to head towards Man Mo Dim Sum. Unfortunately we finally got there and found we needed reservations. So we walked a little further and found Ka Ho around the corner. This was a very very local Cantonese place - no English spoken and definitely no tourists. Luckily, ordering dimsum was off a picture menu otherwise we would have starved. Even so, the wait staff got a kick out of us for having the nerve (or ignorance) to enter and sit down. Imagine, Chinese people who speak no chinese! Luckily, I had already read about dipping the bowls/utensils in the hot water ritual. So maybe that got us some street cred. We made it through the meal - the dim sum was delicious although probably not the best HK has to offer. Afterwards, we went to the Central market area to get my wife a pair of shorts because she had forgotten to pack any. For dinner, we met two friends of ours for dinner who took us to a local place in Central. We took the ""ding ding"" light rail trains right outside the hotel pretty much everywhere."

Re: Trip Report – Hong Kong, Nov 2023 – 4 days","Day 2: We were meeting a cousin for lunch in Wan Chai. So in the morning we decided to take the Star ferry from Central pier across to Kowloon. Again, it wasn't a sunny clear day - a little rainy. But still worth doing. My wife had heard about the egg tarts at Bakehouse in Tsim Sha Tsui on the Kowloon side so we made the short walk to Hankow Rd. When we arrived at around 9:30 am, the line was all the way down the block. We waited about 20 mins, hardly moved, and decided we needed to invoke Plan B. Wife found another bakery whose name I forget. We had to take a 15 min taxi ride but it was easy. We got our egg tarts and headed back to the ferry. We got back to Wan Chai and had about 45 mins to walk through the market. It's always fun to see all the shops and especially the outdoor meat and seafood markets. I got some good video footage of the cage of live frogs for sale by the pound - you don't really see that back in the States. We met my cousin for dim sum at Sportful Garden in Wan Chai. The dim sum was good. We had never tried pigeon before but it was good to try. Very nice Chinese restaurant. Dinner that night was at Yat Lok on Stanley St for their Michelin Star roast goose. We had to wait but totally worth it. I posted a review here. Bottom line, I highly recommend as long as you do some research and know what sort of restaurant it is. It's not anything remotely close to fine dining. Just delicious roast goose in a crowded little restaurant. Day 3: This was our last full day and it was a choice between visiting Lantau and the Buddha or doing a day trip to Macau. Our friends had not been to Macau yet so we opted for that. We would've preferred to go to the Outer Harbor first but since we didn't book in advance, the next one was to Taipa so we opted for that. Once off the ferry, all the casinos have buses waiting to pick you up to take you to the hotels. So we hopped on the Wynn Palace shuttle and headed there. Only took about 15 mins. We spent the morning walking the Wynn, the Venetian, the relatively new Londoner and also the Parisien. The Venetian has a massive food court which suited us well for lunch. From the MGM, we took their shuttle over to the MGM Grand on the Peninsula side. From there we took a short taxi up to the Ruins at St Paul's and checked that out. Walking from there to Senado Sq, on a Sunday afternoon . . it was super crowded wall to wall people through the narrow streets. We made our way back to the Wynn Macau and hopped their free shuttle to the Outer Harbor terminal to catch a 5 pm ferry back. I don't know if coming or going to Macau is typically more smooth. But heading back to HK was a pretty rough ride. Day 4: Departure day - Our flight to Tokyo (next stop) wasn't until 11:30 am. So lo and behold, the wife found that Bakehouse has a store in Central, so we took a taxi there and got there when it opened at 8 am. So we were able to get our egg tarts after all, which, were a little better and fresher than the ones we got in Macau. We came straight back to the hotel, got our luggage, and took the Courtyard's free shuttle to Hong Kong station. From there we took the MRT out to the airport which, on a sunny day, was a pleasant trip. All in all, if we weren't there to see friends/family, we probably would have done and seen much more even in a short 4 day visit. That is actually our style. I definitely wanted to see the Buddha and spend a day on Lantau. But oh well, next time."

Re: Best electronic place that sell all.,"My thought: if you are going to Huaqiangbei in Shenzhen anyway, you may not need to visit Golden in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, you may find a mix of parts made in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, etc.. In Shenzhen, likely mostly those manufactured in China. They may (or likely may not) be parts used by brand name products, but after-market replacements, or ""compatibles"", or ""something like"". If you are looking for functional, generic parts, that's probably good. It is best if you know your stuff. I think you may find prices of parts higher in Hong Kong and a variety of prices. (Quality usually is proportional to price. You need to weigh that in your considerations.) Inside Hong Kong's Golden Computer Centre, shops and merchandises are very packed. Often those tiny shops do not have a comfortable ""viewing"" space. And the shop-keepers, being in Hong Kong, often just ""go go go"". Patience is not compatible with their business survival. Best is to hone in on what you are looking for, and compare offers and prices."

Re: Straight from HKIA to Macau early AM?,"Personally with only 4 days, you might want to just focus on visiting Hong Kong. Also flight arrivals, followed by two consecutive days of crossing international borders and hotel check-ins is a big time and energy drain. You might be doing yourself and your group a big favour by going straight to your hotel in HK where and staying there all four nights. If you really want to visit Macau, no problem. Just do a day trip over using the 24 hour shuttle service over the HZM Bridge or use ferries between the two cities. This would be much more convenient than dragging your luggage over to Macau and checking into a hotel (usually 2-3pm check-ins in Macau) and having to repeat that experience again the next morning, taking all of your luggage back to HK to check into another hotel. I would only do something like this if I knew transportation around both cities very well and was traveling with very light luggage only."

Re: Octopus Tourist Card or Tap and go Credit Card,"I've used the new visa tap a couple of times to see how it works. The physical card swipe is just as easy as using your octopus card going into and out of the MTR. Note, when exiting the MTR, you have to pull out your card and swipe again, the visa scanner doesn't seem to read through physical wallets. You can also use Iphone wallet linked visa card but its less convenient. You have to open your wallet, select card, scan and then double tap to confirm payment on the way into the MTR station. It is a bit quicker on the way of the MTR after your ride. Note: Not all entry gates have the visa scanners installed as of yet. You have to look for them. They have an extra scanner facing you with Visa shown above. Fairly easy to spot."
